"Leap Before You Look' by W. H. Auden is all about taking risks in life and having an action-oriented mind. In this poem, Auden talks about how sometimes people should embrace uncertainty in life. His speaker refers to the very presence of danger in each step of life. It is crucial for his friend if he wants to do great things in his life. The way things are supposed to be done might not change, but the fear of doing something uniquely should be eliminated. People who constantly worry about the outcomes and take everything too seriously might not be able to live to the fullest. They fail to recognize the chances and restrain themselves due to their cautiousness. Furthermore, Auden comments upon society “consenting” to live as mere sheep. People tend to follow the flock or the way others lead their lives. They never take a route of their own. The speaker counsels against this mindset throughout the poem.","Generate a short summary of Leap Before You Look by W. H. Auden by W.H. Auden: The sense of danger must not disappear:
 The way is certainly both short and steep,
 However gradual it looks from here;
 Look if you like, but you will have to leap.
 

 Tough-minded men get mushy in their sleep
 And break the by-laws any fool can keep;
 It is not the convention but the fear
 That has a tendency to disappear.
 

 The worried efforts of the busy heap,
 The dirt, the imprecision, and the beer
 Produce a few smart wisecracks every year;
 Laugh if you can, but you will have to leap.
 

 The clothes that are considered right to wear
 Will not be either sensible or cheap,
 So long as we consent to live like sheep
 And never mention those who disappear.
 

 Much can be said for social savoir-faire,
 But to rejoice when no one else is there
 Is even harder than it is to weep;
 No one is watching, but you have to leap.
 

 A solitude ten thousand fathoms deep
 Sustains the bed on which we lie, my dear:
 Although I love you, you will have to leap;
 Our dream of safety has to disappear.","Leap Before You Look' is a poem by W.H. Auden, first published in 1940, that encourages action and embracing uncertainty over caution and hesitation. The poem's title is a play on the proverb 'look before you leap,' inverting its meaning to advocate for taking risks and making bold moves. The poem's structure, with four-line stanzas and an abab rhyme scheme, creates a sense of forward motion, pushing the reader towards the inevitable leap. Auden's message is not that the leap is without difficulty or fear, but rather that it is necessary. The poem acknowledges the sense of danger and the steep, short path that lies ahead, but urges the reader to take the leap regardless. This message is particularly relevant in times of transition or change, as the poem encourages readers to embrace the unknown and take action, even if it means letting go of preconceived notions or plans. The poem's themes of action, uncertainty, and transition resonate with the author of the article, who reflects on a video taken of herself two years ago, at the halfway point of her time at Tufts University. She reflects on the expectations she had for the next two years and the experiences that ultimately forced her to grow and develop close friendships. While she feels some grief for the plans that didn't come to fruition, she appreciates the necessary leaps that led to meaningful experiences and relationships.

 drinking with the other;

 The covers pleased her:
 One bleached from lying in a sunny place,
 One marked in circles by a vase of water,
 One mended, when a tidy fit had seized her,
 And coloured, by her daughter -
 So they had waited, till, in widowhood
 She found them, looking for something else, and stood
 

 Relearning how each frank submissive chord
 Had ushered in
 Word after sprawling hyphenated word,
 And the unfailing sense of being young
 Spread out like a spring-woken tree, wherein
 That hidden freshness sung,
 That certainty of time laid up in store
 As when she played them first. But, even more,
 

 The glare of that much-mentionned brilliance, love,
 Broke out, to show
 Its bright incipience sailing above,
 Still promising to solve, and satisfy,
 And set unchangeably in order. So
 To pile them back, to cry,
 Was hard, without lamely admitting how
 It had not done so then, and could not now.","Love Songs in Age' is a poem by Philip Larkin that explores the theme of nostalgia and the passing of time.

"Another Valentine' by Wendy Cope presents the real meaning of Valentine's day and most importantly the meaning of romantic love. This poem begins with the poetic persona's ironic statement.

 Said to Mark behind her back;

 Who has the hots for Jack.

 Flicker after tits and baskets;

 The Love that rules the sun and stars
 Permits what He forbids.

 In a sinner’s lap lies curled;
 Drunken absent-minded fingers
 Pat a sinless world.

 In her call, Collect, to Rome?

 Tells me to go home.

 Playing hard to get…

 You would think I’d just been given a substantial meal,
 I see all their good points.
 The railroad sheds are full of greenish-yellow electricity,
 It’s the great mad-day hour in London...that suddenly goes brown.
 ...My stupefying efforts make money
 And to have a life!
 Well, I’m leaving; nothing can hold me.
 

 

 The platforms are dense to the foot,
 Rich, strong-willed travellers pace about in the dark daylight,
 And how they stink of green fatty soaps, the rich.
 More dirty weather...you can hardly see the newspaper stand
 With its abominable, ludicrous papers...which are so touching
 I ought to laugh and cry, instead of gritting my teeth.
 

 

 Let me inhale the filthy air for the last time
 Good heavens, how vile it is...I could take you step by step
 Back among the twilight buildings, into my old life...
 

 

 The trains come in, boiling, caked !
 The station half tames them, there’s the sound of blows; the uproar!
 And I -- I behave as though I’ve been starved of noise,
 My intestinr eats up this big music
 And my new bourgeois soul promptly bursts into flames, in mid-air.
 

 

 No use pouring me a few last minutes of the old life
 From your tank of shadow, filled with lost and rotten people,
 I admit: the same flow of gutter-sugar to the brain...
 

 

 No one to see me off -- Ah!
 I would like to be seen off; it must be the same agonizing woman
 Who does not want to understand me, and who exposes me in public,
 So that I can turn away, choked with the cold bile,
 And feel myself loved absoltely; the bitch.
 

 

 These carriages, that have heavy brown and black bread
 Up their sides! But look out for the moment of cowardice,
 It’s Charon’s rowing-boat that lurches and fouls my hand
 As I climb on -- exile, Limboist.
 

 

 ...The way these people get on with thir lives; I bow down
 With my few deeds and my lotus scars.
 Last minutes...last greenish-yellow minutes
 Of the lost and rotten hours...faro, and old winters dimmed,
 On which the dark -- Yes, the black sugar-crust is forming, London.
 

 

 I’m leaving! Nothing can hold me!
 The trains, watered and greased, scream to be off.
 Hullo -- I’m already sticking out my elbows for a piece of territory,
 I occupy my place as though I can’t get enough of it
 -- And with what casual, haughty, and specific gestures, incidentally.
 

 

 Tradesmen, Pigs, regenerative trains -- I shall be saved!
 I shall go to the centre of Europe; gliding,
 As children skate on the diamond lid of the lake
 Never touching gound -- Xenophile, on the blue-plated meadows.
 

 

 Oh I shall live off myself, rainclothes, documents,
 The great train simmers....Life is large, large!
 ...I shall live off your loaf of shadows, London;
 I admit it, at the last.","The Love Feast' by W.H. Auden is a poem that explores the complexities of contemporary life within a religious context.

"Chainsaw Versus the Pampas Grass' by Simon Armitage is an amusing depiction of one man's violent, and doomed to fail, battle with nature. The poem begins with the speaker going into detail about a chainsaw. He's preparing it for a task, and like a caged animal it is ready to let its anger loose on whatever source the speaker chooses. Armitage makes use of personification throughout this poem, using it to describe the chainsaw as a snarling dangerous animal, but also its victim, the pampas grass. This large plant is located somewhere in the speaker's yard and he's determined to use his very angry chainsaw to destroy it. At first, things seem to be going well. He attacks the plant with the machine and it is felled easily. It is compared throughout these stanzas to something weak, floral, and in the end feminine. It presents a striking contrast against the chainsaw which is all testosterone and unmanaged rage. Things take a turn towards the end of the poem when the only thing left is the base of the plant. The speaker can't get it ripped out of the ground so he sets it on fire. Unfortunately for him, the plant survives and by June it has regrown and nature has asserted its dominance once more over humankind.","Generate a short summary of Chainsaw Versus the Pampas Grass by Simon Armitage by Simon Armitage: It seemed an unlikely match. All winter unplugged,
 grinding its teeth in a plastic sleeve, the chainsaw swung
 nose-down from a hook in the darkroom
 under the hatch in the floor. When offered the can
 it knocked back a quarter-pint of engine oil
 and juices ran from its joints and threads,
 oozed across the guide-bar and the maker’s name,
 into the dry links.
 

 From the summerhouse, still holding one last gulp
 of last year’s heat behind its double doors, and hung
 with the weightless wreckage of wasps and flies,
 moth-balled in spider’s wool…
 from there, I trailed the day-glo orange power-line
 the length of the lawn and the garden path,
 fed it out like powder from a keg, then walked
 back to the socket and flicked the switch, then walked again
 and coupled the saw to the flex – clipped them together.
 Then dropped the safety catch and gunned the trigger.
 No gearing up or getting to speeds, just an instant rage,
 the rush of metal lashing out at air, connected to the main.
 The chainsaw with its perfect disregard, its mood
 to tangle with cloth, or jewellery, or hair.
 The chainsaw with its bloody desire, its sweet tooth
 for the flesh of the face and the bones underneath,
 its grand plan to kick back against nail or knot
 and rear up into the brain.
 I let it flare, lifted it into the sun
 and felt the hundred beats per second drumming in its heart,
 and felt the drive-wheel gargle in its throat.
 

 The pampas grass with its ludicrous feathers
 and plumes. The pampas grass, taking the warmth and light
 from cuttings and bulbs, sunning itself,
 stealing the show with its footstools, cushions and tufts
 and its twelve-foot spears.
 

 This was the sledgehammer taken to crack the nut.
 Probably all that was needed here was a good pull or shove
 or a pitchfork to lever it out at its base.
 Overkill. I touched the blur of the blade
 against the nearmost tip of a reed – it didn’t exist.
 I dabbed at a stalk that swooned, docked a couple of heads, dismissed the top third of its canes with a sideways sweep
 at shoulder height – this was a game.
 I lifted the fringe of undergrowth, carved at the trunk –
 plant-juice spat from the pipes and tubes
 and dust flew out as I ripped into pockets of dark, secret
 warmth.
 To clear a space to work
 I raked whatever was severed or felled or torn
 towards the dead zone under the outhouse wall, to be fired.
 Then cut and raked, cut and raked, till what was left
 was a flat stump the size of a manhole cover or barrel lid
 that wouldn’t be dug with a spade or prized from the earth. Wanting to finish things off I took up the saw
 and drove it vertically downwards into the upper roots,
 but the blade became choked with soil or fouled with weeds,
 or what was sliced or split somehow closed and mended
 behind, like cutting at water or air with a knife.
 I poured barbecue fluid into the patch
 and threw in a match – it flamed for a minute, smoked for a minute more, and went
 out. I left it at that.
 

 In the weeks that came new shoots like asparagus tips
 sprang up from its nest and by June
 it was riding high in its saddle, wearing a new crown.
 Corn in Egypt. I looked on
 from the upstairs window like the midday moon.
 

 Back below stairs on its hook, the chainsaw seethed.
 I left it a year, to work back through its man-made dreams,
 to try to forget.
 The seamless urge to persist was as far as it got.","Errata' is a poetry collection by Kevin Young in which he explores the concept of mistakes, their impact on our lives, and the process of acknowledging and learning from them. The book is divided into five sections, each focusing on different aspects of error, including personal mistakes, historical inaccuracies, and the fallibility of memory. Young's poems delve into the emotional weight of errors and how they shape our identities, drawing from various sources like history, literature, and pop culture. The collection also reflects on the role of language in shaping our perception of truth and falsehood.","In ""Chainsaw Versus the Pampas Grass,"" Simon Armitage describes the unlikely encounter between a dormant chainsaw and a pampas grass plant. The chainsaw, awakened from its winter slumber, is eager to unleash its power, while the pampas grass, basking in the summer sun, seems to taunt it with its lush feathers. The speaker attempts to use the chainsaw to destroy the pampas grass, but finds that it's an overkill. He realizes that a simple pull or shove would have been enough to uproot the plant. Despite this, the chainsaw continues to long for destruction, and the speaker leaves it hanging, waiting to be used again. The pampas grass, however, quickly recovers and thrives, leaving the chainsaw to seethe in frustration on its hook.","In ""Chainsaw Versus the Pampas Grass"" by Simon Armitage, the speaker describes a surreal and violent encounter between a chainsaw and a pampas grass plant. The poem begins with the speaker preparing the chainsaw, which has been idle all winter, and then unleashing it on the pampas grass. The chainsaw is described as having a ""perfect disregard"" and a ""bloody desire"" to cut and destroy the plant.
The speaker uses the chainsaw to hack at the pampas grass, cutting off its stalks and leaves, and eventually reducing it to a stump. The poem is a meditation on the destructive power of the chainsaw and the speaker's own desire to dominate and control the natural world.
Throughout the poem, Armitage uses vivid imagery and metaphor to describe the encounter between the chainsaw and the pampas grass. The chainsaw is likened to a ""sledgehammer"" and a ""bloody desire"" that is driven by a ""seamless urge to persist"". The pampas grass, on the other hand, is described as having ""ludicrous feathers"" and ""plumes"" that are ""stealing the show"" with its ""footstools, cushions and tufts"".
The poem also touches on themes of overkill and the futility of trying to dominate nature. The speaker notes that a simple pull or shove would have been enough to remove the pampas grass, but instead they chose to use the chainsaw, which is an ""overkill"" that leaves the plant in a state of disarray.
Ultimately, the poem is a commentary on the human desire to control and dominate the natural world, and the futility of trying to do so. The speaker's use of the chainsaw is a metaphor for the destructive power of human technology and the way it can be used to dominate and destroy the natural world.","The poem describes a confrontation between a chainsaw and a large, stubborn pampas grass plant in the speaker's garden. The chainsaw, which has been dormant all winter, is suddenly brought out and unleashed on the pampas grass, which the speaker sees as an overgrown nuisance.
The speaker describes the chainsaw's power and aggression, its ""bloody desire"" and ""sweet tooth for the flesh of the face and the bones underneath."" He then describes the pampas grass, with its ""ludicrous feathers and plumes,"" as a formidable opponent.
The speaker attacks the pampas grass relentlessly with the chainsaw, cutting and raking until only a stump remains. But even this does not defeat the plant, as new shoots soon spring up. The speaker admits this was ""overkill"" and that a simpler approach may have worked.
In the end, the chainsaw is left to ""work back through its man-made dreams"" and the pampas grass reasserts itself, leaving the speaker feeling defeated. The poem explores the futility of trying to completely subdue nature through brute force."
"Only Child by D. Nurkse begins by focusing on the moments after the birth of Nurkse's child, holding his Only Child after her birth. He realizes she knows nothing, having just come from the place 'where there was no world', not even knowing 'what a voice was'. He cradles her as he looks at the newborn. The second stanza moves in the child having a voice, asking Nurkse to watch her while 'cartwheel, the skip, the tumble' happen. This second stanza child is demanding, finding her voice, and asking for her father's attention. The third stanza examines a scene in which father and daughter are on a seesaw, with Nurkse writing that she 'has power' to lift him off the ground. This is a metaphor for how influential his daughter has become in his life, able to lift him and control him, despite her 'tiny weight'. The poem is a tribute to parenthood.","Generate a short summary of Only Child by D. Nurkse by D. Nurkse: 1
 I cradled my newborn daughter
 and felt the heartbeat
 pull me out of shock.
 She didn’t know
 what her hands were:
 she folded them. I asked her
 was there a place
 where there was no world.
 She didn’t know
 what a voice was: her lips
 were the shape of a nipple.
 2
 In the park the child says:
 watch me. It will not count
 unless you see. And she shows me
 the cartwheel, the skip, the tumble,
 the tricks performed at leisure in midair,
 each unknown until it is finished.
 At home she orders:
 see me eat. I watch her
 curl on herself, sleep;
 as I try to leave the dark room
 her dreaming voice commands me: watch.
 3
 Always we passed the seesaw
 on the way to the swings
 but tonight I remember
 the principle of the lever,
 I sit the child at one end,
 I sit near the center,
 the fulcrum, at once she has power
 to lift me off the earth
 and keep me suspended
 by her tiny weight, she laughing,
 I stunned at the power of the formula.","The Love Feast' is a poem by W.H. Auden, first published in his 1960 collection 'Homage to Clio.' The poem explores the theme of love and human connection in the context of a communal meal, or 'love feast.' It reflects on the capacity of shared experiences, such as eating together, to foster a sense of unity and understanding among diverse individuals.

"The Fly' by Ogden Nash is a short poem in which the speaker speaks amusingly about a fly and how it is perceived by most people. The first line tells the reader, quite simply, that God made the fly in “his wisdom”. This sarcastic phrase is followed up by its second half in the second line.

"Love on the Farm' by D.H. Lawrence is a beautiful and powerful poem that describes some of the many elements of life and death observable on a farm.

They go on to describe a honeysuckle plant seeking out her lover, a bird's marriage bed, and a shed. They speak on the movement of a farmer and a rabbit caught in a snare. As the poem comes to its conclusion, death, or an unnamed and loosely described predator, comes for the speaker themselves.","Generate a short summary of Love on the Farm by D.H. Lawrence by D.H. Lawrence: What large, dark hands are those at the window
 Lifted, grasping the golden light
 Which weaves its way through the creeper leaves
 To my heart’s delight?
 Ah, only the leaves! But in the west,
 In the west I see a redness come
 Over the evening’s burning breast--
 --’Tis the wound of love goes home!
 The woodbine creeps abroad
 Calling low to her lover:
 The sun-lit flirt who all the day
 Has poised above her lips in play
 And stolen kisses, shallow and gay
 Of pollen, now has gone away
 --She woos the moth with her sweet, low word,
 And when above her his broad wings hover
 Then her bright breast she will uncover
 And yield her honey-drop to her lover.
 Into the yellow, evening glow
 Saunters a man from the farm below,
 Leans, and looks in at the low-built shed
 Where hangs the swallow’s marriage bed.
 The bird lies warm against the wall.
 She glances quick her startled eyes
 Towards him, then she turns away
 Her small head, making warm display
 Of red upon the throat. His terrors sway
 Her out of the nest’s warm, busy ball,
 Whose plaintive cry is heard as she flies
 In one blue stoop from out the sties
 Into the evening’s empty hall.
 Oh, water-hen, beside the rushes
 Hide your quaint, unfading blushes,
 Still your quick tail, and lie as dead,
 Till the distance folds over his ominous tread.
 The rabbit presses back her ears,
 Turns back her liquid, anguished eyes
 And crouches low: then with wild spring
 Spurts from the terror of _his_ oncoming
 To be choked back, the wire ring
 Her frantic effort throttling:
 Piteous brown ball of quivering fears!
 Ah soon in his large, hard hands she dies,
 And swings all loose to the swing of his walk.
 Yet calm and kindly are his eyes
 And ready to open in brown surprise
 Should I not answer to his talk
 Or should he my tears surmise.
 I hear his hand on the latch, and rise from my chair
 Watching the door open: he flashes bare
 His strong teeth in a smile, and flashes his eyes
 In a smile like triumph upon me; then careless-wise
 He flings the rabbit soft on the table board
 And comes towards me: ah, the uplifted sword
 Of his hand against my bosom, and oh, the broad
 Blade of his hand that raise my face to applaud
 His coming: he raises up my face to him
 And caresses my mouth with his fingers, which still smell grim
 Of the rabbit’s fur! God, I am caught in a snare!
 I know not what fine wire is round my throat,
 I only know I let him finger there
 My pulse of life, letting him nose like a stoat
 Who sniffs with joy before he drinks the blood:
 And down his mouth comes to my mouth, and down
 His dark bright eyes descend like a fiery hood
 Upon my mind: his mouth meets mine, and a flood
 Of sweet fire sweeps across me, so I drown
 Within him, die, and find death good.",,"""Love on the Farm"" is a poem by D.H. Lawrence that explores the raw and intense passion of love.

"This is the deathbed scene and the family has gathered around as Heaney's mother takes her last breaths. His father says a few words in her ear, and the impact of his utterances have a profound effect on the children. We would thus expect the themes of this poem to center around grief and loss, and this is true in one sense; however, there is also relief and joy when we read the poem carefully.","Generate a short summary of Clearances by Seamus Heaney by Seamus Heaney: She taught me what her uncle once taught her:
 How easily the biggest coal block split
 If you got the grain and hammer angled right.
 

 The sound of that relaxed alluring blow,
 Its co-opted and obliterated echo,
 Taught me to hit, taught me to loosen,
 

 Taught me between the hammer and the block
 To face the music. Teach me now to listen,
 To strike it rich behind the linear black.
 

 A cobble thrown a hundred years ago
 Keeps coming at me, the first stone
 Aimed at a great-grandmother's turncoat brow.
 The pony jerks and the riot's on.
 She's crouched low in the trap
 Running the gauntlet that first Sunday
 Down the brae to Mass at a panicked gallop.
 He whips on through the town to cries of 'Lundy!'
 

 Call her 'The Convert'. 'The Exogamous Bride'.
 Anyhow, it is a genre piece
 Inherited on my mother's side
 And mine to dispose with now she's gone.
 Instead of silver and Victorian lace,
 The exonerating, exonerated stone.
 

 Polished linoleum shone there. Brass taps shone.
 The china cups were very white and big—
 An unchipped set with sugar bowl and jug.
 The kettle whistled. Sandwich and tea scone
 Were present and correct. In case it run,
 The butter must be kept out of the sun.
 And don't be dropping crumbs. Don't tilt your chair.
 Don't reach. Don't point. Don't make noise when you stir.
 

 It is Number 5, New Row, Land of the Dead,
 Where grandfather is rising from his place
 With spectacles pushed back on a clean bald head
 To welcome a bewildered homing daughter
 Before she even knocks. 'What's this? What's this?'
 And they sit down in the shining room together.
 

 When all the others were away at Mass
 I was all hers as we peeled potatoes.
 They broke the silence, let fall one by one
 Like solder weeping off the soldering iron:
 Cold comforts set between us, things to share
 Gleaming in a bucket of clean water.
 And again let fall. Little pleasant splashes
 From each other's work would bring us to our senses.
 

 So while the parish priest at her bedside
 Went hammer and tongs at the prayers for the dying
 And some were responding and some crying
 I remembered her head bent towards my head,
 Her breath in mine, our fluent dipping knives—
 Never closer the whole rest of our lives.
 

 Fear of affectation made her affect
 Inadequacy whenever it came to
 Pronouncing words 'beyond her'. Bertold Brek.
 She'd manage something hampered and askew
 Every time, as if she might betray
 The hampered and inadequate by too
 Well-adjusted a vocabulary.
 With more challenge than pride, she'd tell me, 'You
 Know all them things.' So I governed my tongue
 In front of her, a genuinely well-
 Adjusted adequate betrayal
 Of what I knew better. I'd naw and aye
 And decently relapse into the wrong
 Grammar which kept us allied and at bay.
 

 The cool that came off sheets just off the line
 Made me think the damp must still be in them
 But when I took my corners of the linen
 And pulled against her, first straight down the hem
 And then diagonally, then flapped and shook
 The fabric like a sail in a cross-wind,
 They made a dried-out undulating thwack.
 So we'd stretch and fold and end up hand to hand
 For a split second as if nothing had happened
 For nothing had that had not always happened
 Beforehand, day by day, just touch and go,
 Coming close again by holding back
 In moves where I was x and she was o
 Inscribed in sheets she'd sewn from ripped-out flour sacks.
 

 In the first flush of the Easter holidays
 The ceremonies during Holy Week
 Were highpoints of our Sons and Lovers phase.
 The midnight fire. The paschal candlestick.
 Elbow to elbow, glad to be kneeling next
 To each other up there near the front
 Of the packed church, we would follow the text
 And rubrics for the blessing of the font.
 As the hind longs for the streams, so my soul. . .
 Dippings. Towellings. The water breathed on.
 The water mixed with chrism and with oil.
 Cruet tinkle. Formal incensation
 And the psalmist's outcry taken up with pride:
 Day and night my tears have been my bread.
 

 In the last minutes he said more to her
 Almost than in all their life together.
 'You'll be in New Row on Monday night
 And I'll come up for you and you'll be glad
 When I walk in the door . . . Isn't that right?'
 His head was bent down to her propped-up head.
 She could not hear but we were overjoyed.
 He called her good and girl. Then she was dead,
 The searching for a pulsebeat was abandoned
 And we all knew one thing by being there.
 The space we stood around had been emptied
 Into us to keep, it penetrated
 Clearances that suddenly stood open.
 High cries were felled and a pure change happened.
 

 I thought of walking round and round a space
 Utterly empty, utterly a source
 Where the decked chestnut tree had lost its place
 In our front hedge above the wallflowers.
 The white chips jumped and jumped and skited high.
 I heard the hatchet's differentiated
 Accurate cut, the crack, the sigh
 And collapse of what luxuriated
 Through the shocked tips and wreckage of it all.
 Deep-planted and long gone, my coeval
 Chestnut from a jam jar in a hole,
 Its heft and hush become a bright nowhere,
 A soul ramifying and forever

"Blowin' in the Wind' by Bob Dylan poses a series of questions to ironically point to humankind's passivity over the cruelties and brutal reality of the 20th century. Dylan's song describes how the things happening around the world pains a speaker deeply. This speaker belongs to the century when discrimination according to color and origin existed, basic human rights were denied, and above all the harrowing air of war was raging everywhere. In such a critical situation, a speaker asks several questions to his fellow human beings. It seems everyone knows the answer to his simple questions, yet they are ignoring reality. For example, he alludes to the World Wars in the first stanza and asks how long this problematic situation is going to exist. In the following stanzas, he taps on the issues of racism, confinement, ignorance, freedom, death, and distress.","Generate a short summary of Blowin’ in the Wind by Bob Dylan by Bob Dylan: How many roads must a man walk down

The lyrics pose a series of rhetorical questions, each followed by the answer, ""The answer is blowin' in the wind.""

Some examples include ""How many roads must a man walk down before you call him a man?"" and ""How many times must a man turn his head, pretending he just doesn't see?"" The overall message seems to be that the answers to life's most profound questions are not easily found and may require a deep understanding and empathy for others. The wind symbolizes the elusive nature of these answers.","In ""Blowin' in the Wind,"" Bob Dylan poses a series of rhetorical questions that challenge the status quo and encourage listeners to think critically about social justice and freedom. He asks how many times a person must walk down a road, sail across the sea, or turn their head before they are considered a man, free, or able to see the truth. He also asks how many years a mountain must exist before it's washed away, how many times a man must look up to see the sky, and how many deaths it will take before people realize that too many have died. Throughout the song, Dylan's lyrics are infused with a sense of longing and frustration, as he searches for answers to these questions and implores his listeners to join him in his quest for truth and justice. The song's iconic refrain, ""The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind,"" suggests that the answers to these questions are not easily found, but rather are hidden in the wind, waiting to be discovered.","The song poses a series of rhetorical questions about war, freedom, and the human condition.

The song encourages the listener to ponder these deep questions and seek their own answers."
"In short form, 'I Said To Love' is a love poem by Thomas Hardy that looks at loss and a sense of regret for what he has lost (referring to his passed wife, Emma). He comes across as having a bad experience with love that has punished him with feelings of remorse and pain come across in this poem. With this pain, Hardy personified Love so that he can take out the pain on the personification of Love. “Love” appears to him as an unkind man who once showed him the positive sides of it. But, now as he has lost his wife, it is giving him extreme distress. He tells love to leave at once and relieve him from the pain he is suffering after the loss of his dear one.","Generate a short summary of I Said To Love by Thomas Hardy by Thomas Hardy: I said to Love,

 We clamoured thee that thou would'st please
 Inflict on us thine agonies,""
 I said to him.
 I said to Love,
 ""Thou art not young, thou art not fair,
 No faery darts, no cherub air,
 Nor swan, nor dove
 Are thine; but features pitiless,
 And iron daggers of distress,""
 I said to Love.
 ""Depart then, Love! . . .

 Know nothing of? -
 We fear not such a threat from thee;
 We are too old in apathy!
 Mankind shall cease.--So let it be,""
 I said to Love.",,"In the poem ""I Said to Love"" by Thomas Hardy, the speaker addresses Love and acknowledges that their understanding of it has changed. They no longer believe Love to be the source of all goodness and pleasure, but rather recognize its painful aspects. The speaker describes Love as no longer young or fair, but rather featuring ""pitiless"" features and ""iron daggers of distress."" The speaker then dismisses Love, expressing that humanity's end does not fear from it and that mankind will cease to exist regardless.","In ""I Said to Love"" by Thomas Hardy, the speaker addresses Love, expressing a sense of disillusionment and frustration. They recall the past when people idealized Love, but now they see it as a cruel and pitiless force that inflicts suffering. The speaker argues that humanity has grown older and wiser, no longer naive to Love's true nature. They reject Love's power, saying that humanity will eventually cease to exist, and that they are too apathetic to care. The poem is a commentary on the fleeting nature of romantic love and the speaker's desire to break free from its constraints.","The poem ""I Said to Love"" by Thomas Hardy expresses the speaker's disillusionment with love. The speaker reflects on how love was once revered and idealized, but now is seen as a source of pain and suffering. The speaker directly addresses love, criticizing its lack of youth and beauty, and its capacity to inflict ""agonies"" and ""distress"" on those who love. Ultimately, the speaker rejects love, suggesting that humanity will cease to exist, implying that love is no longer necessary or relevant. The poem conveys a sense of cynicism and resignation towards the power and nature of love."
"Sonnet 31 Analysis With how sad steps, O Moon, thou climb'st the skies! How silently, and with how wan a face! What, may it be that even in heav'nly place That busy archer his sharp arrows tries! Sure, if that long-with love-acquainted eyes Can judge of love, thou feel'st a lover's case, I read it in thy looks; thy languish'd grace To me, that feel the like, thy state descries. The octet depicts the lyrical voice's perception of the moon. The poem starts by describing how the moon rises in the sky at night. The lyrical voice personifies the moon (“O Moon, thou climb'st the skies!) and projects his/ own sorrows in the moon (“With how sad steps”). The lyrical voice describes the moon carefully, as an individual being: “How silently, and with how wan face!”. There is a repetition of the word “how” in order to emphasize the lyrical voice's attention to the object that he is describing. The lyrical voice questions about the moon's sadness, and figures that it must be because of “What, may it be that even in heav'nly place /That busy archer his sharp arrows tries” (cupid). The lyrical voice's connection of his feelings to those of the moon is an example of a “pathetic fallacy”, where elements of nature appear to have human emotions. The lyrical voice suggests that the moon is struggling with sentimental problems, as he can see them from experiencing them himself: Sure, if that long-with love-acquainted eyes /Can judge of love, thou feel'st a lover's case”. This furthers the personification and the “phatetic fallacy” mentioned before. The lyrical voice can “read it in thy looks” and the moon appears to be, again, weak (“thy languish'd grace”). This portrait of the moon shows the lyrical voice's assurance about the moon being lovesick. Once again, the lyrical voice compares the moon's state to his, making a direct relationship between the moon's suffering and his (“To me, that feel the like, thy state descries”). Notice how the unusual syntax accentuates the words of suffering that the lyrical voice is expressing. Then, ev'n of fellowship, O Moon, tell me, Is constant love deem'd there but want of wit? Are beauties there as proud as here they be? Do they above love to be lov'd, and yet Those lovers scorn whom that love doth possess? Do they call virtue there ungratefulness? The sestet presents a series of questions that are crucial to the lyrical voice. The focus of the poem shifts from the description of the moon to the lyrical voice's reflections about love. This is the typical volta, turn, that occurs in the Petrarchan sonnet. The lyrical voice asks the moon (“Then, ev'n of fellowship, O Moon, tell me”) whether, in the sky, love is treated as “want of wit”. Moreover, he asks if women are as proud as they are on earth (“Are beauties there as proud as here they be?”). This series of questions project problems that the lyrical voice is dealing with. The lyrical voice in 'Sonnet 31′ still has more questions. He wants to know whether the things above like to be loved. Notice the internal rhyme in the fourth line. Moreover, he wants to know if the beloved ones like the ones who are in love with them (“Those lovers scorn whom that love doth possess? “). Again, the lyrical voice is questioning and thinking about his own sentimental struggles and his relationship with Stella. The final line continues with the questions and the complaints that the lyrical voice has expressed in the sestet. The lyrical voice asks whether “above” love is despised to (“Do they call virtue there ungratefulness?”). He feels that love is a virtue, but it sounds like his beloved one, Stella, doesn't feel the same way about the lyrical voice's display of virtue and constant love. The tone of the sestet shows that the lyrical voice is deeply wounded and the rhetorical questions accentuate this pain.","Generate a short summary of Sonnet 31 by Sir Philip Sidney by Philip Sidney: With how sad steps, O Moon, thou climb’st the skies!

He wonders if the moon, as a symbol of love, experiences the same longing and heartache that earthly lovers do. Sidney questions if constancy and love are valued in heaven, or if beauty there is as proud and unappreciative as it is on earth. He ponders if the virtues of love and loyalty are considered ungratefulness in the celestial realm.","In Sonnet 31, Sir Philip Sidney laments the Moon's melancholy ascent into the sky, wondering if even in heaven, love is fleeting and unrequited. He believes that the Moon's ""languished grace"" and ""wan face"" reveal a lover's pain, and he asks the Moon to confirm his suspicions. He inquires if constant love is seen as a lack of wit in heaven, if beauty is as proud as it is on earth, and if those who are loved scorn those who love them. The poem is a meditation on the nature of love and its treatment in the afterlife, with the speaker seeking answers to the mysteries of the universe.","The speaker addresses the moon, observing its sad and weary appearance as it climbs the sky. The speaker wonders if even in the heavenly realm, the ""busy archer"" (Cupid) is testing his arrows. The speaker believes the moon's languished expression reflects the experience of a lover, and asks the moon to share if constant love is seen as a lack of wisdom in the heavens. The speaker questions whether the beauties there are as proud as those on Earth, and if they disdain those who love them, considering such love to be ungrateful."
"Description of Spring' by Henry Howard is a simple depiction of spring and how it contrasts with the speaker's emotions. In the first part of the poem, the poet outlines all the wildlife and how each living creature is reacting to spring. He uses examples of personification and anaphora to emphasize how the entire world seems to be shedding the winter and embracing spring. But, as he reveals in the concluding couplet, the season is not uplifting him in the same way. His sorrow is only growing worse because of the beauty and joy he sees around him.","Generate a short summary of Description of Spring by Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey by Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey: The soote season, that bud and bloom forth brings,

 The buck in brake his winter coat he flings;
 The fishes flete with new repaired scale.
 The adder all her slough away she slings;

 Winter is worn that was the flowers' bale.

 Each care decays, and yet my sorrow springs.",,"Description of Spring by Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey is a poetic celebration of the arrival of spring.

However, despite the joy and happiness that spring brings, the poet expresses his own sorrow and melancholy that persists amidst the pleasant surroundings.","The poem describes the arrival of spring, using vivid imagery to depict the season's awakening. The speaker notes the renewal of nature, with hills and valleys covered in green, birds singing, and animals shedding their winter coats.

"Passage to India' by Walt Whitman describes an imaginary journey that a speaker wants to take into fabled India. Passage to India begins with a description of the new marvel of the modern world and how they are part of God's plan. These works, the Suez Canal, the great American Railway, and the transatlantic cable allowed men and women to know one another in a new way. He sees India as a mysterious and fabled place that once visited, will allow the rejuvenation of his soul. He will return to the birthplace of mankind and be renewed for the rest of his life. The Passage to India is not easy, many have died on the way. That scares the speaker, but not so much so as to deter him from undertaking the voyage. The pull of exploration is like a current running through the human race and he is a part of it and wants to feel the connectivity of the earth. The speaker also takes the time to mourn the downfall of men, like Columbus, who ended their lives unhappily. He imagines that he is on this important journey with his soul and that the two of them are circumnavigating the earth together. After asking himself if he is ready to go further on his journey, the reply is an eventual yes and he commands the anchor to be lifted.

"The Snow Fairy' by Claude McKay is a beautifully written poem in which the poet presents two sonnets with similar imagery. The first of the two sonnets focuses on a snowfall, something he compares to “snow-fairies” fighting for supremacy in the sky and then resting peacefully on the ground. He uses personification throughout the piece, until the end when they've “gone,” or melted away. In the second sonnet, the speaker picks his line of thought immediately back up with the word “And.” It appears that the first sonnet has led him to the thoughts he has in the second. He imagines “you,” an unknown listener and the speaker's lover, coming to him and bringing warmth and summer into his home. Together, the two go to bed. When he wakes up, this person is gone as if they left with the dawn as a dream.","Generate a short summary of The Snow Fairy by Claude McKay by Claude McKay: Throughout the afternoon I watched them there,
 Snow-fairies falling, falling from the sky,
 Whirling fantastic in the misty air,
 Contending fierce for space supremacy.

 As though in heaven there was revolt and riot,
 And they, frail things had taken panic flight
 Down to the calm earth seeking peace and quiet.
 I went to bed and rose at early dawn
 To see them huddled together in a heap,
 Each merged into the other upon the lawn,
 Worn out by the sharp struggle, fast asleep.
 The sun shone brightly on them half the day,
 By night they stealthily had stol’n away.

 And suddenly my thoughts then turned to you
 Who came to me upon a winter’s night,
 When snow-sprites round my attic window flew,
 Your hair disheveled, eyes aglow with light.
 My heart was like the weather when you came,
 The wanton winds were blowing loud and long;
 But you, with joy and passion all aflame,
 You danced and sang a lilting summer song.
 I made room for you in my little bed,
 Took covers from the closet fresh and warm,
 A downful pillow for your scented head,
 And lay down with you resting in my arm.

"This phrase, “nothing to fear but fear itself”, is a reference to the sensation of fear that is the worst enemy of humankind. It keeps one aback and troubles one’s soul. The worst form of fear is the gloomy thoughts that create an eerie atmosphere inside one’s mind. Through this phrase, the speaker, FDR, refers to this mental framework that should not be encouraged. As it has a disastrous effect on one’s courage and the nation’s progress as a whole. However, the phrase is paraphrased here and FDR included this rhetorically charged phrase in a different manner.","Generate a short summary of Nothing to fear but fear itself by Franklin D. Roosevelt: First Inaugural Address, March 4, 1932
 This great Nation will endure as it has endured, will revive and will prosper.
 So, first of all, let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear
 itself—nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to
 convert retreat into advance... In such a spirit on my part and on yours we face our
 common difficulties. They concern, thank God, only material things...
 More important, a host of unemployed citizens face the grim problem of
 existence, and an equally great number toil with little return. Only a foolish optimist
 can deny the dark realities of the moment.
 Yet our distress comes from no failure of substance... Plenty is at our
 doorstep, but a generous use of it languishes in the very sight of the supply. Primarily
 this is because the rulers of the exchange of mankind's goods have failed, through
 their own stubbornness and their own incompetence... This nation asks for action,
 and action now.
 Our greatest primary task is to put people to work... It can be accomplished in
 part by direct recruiting by the Government itself, treating the task as we would treat
 the emergency of a war, but at the same time, through this employment,
 accomplishing greatly needed projects to stimulate and reorganize the use of our
 natural resources...
 ...These measures, or such other measures as the Congress may build out of
 its experience and wisdom, I shall seek, within my constitutional authority, to bring to
 speedy adoption.
 But in the event that the Congress shall fail to take one of these two courses,
 and in the event that the national emergency is still critical... I shall ask the Congress
 for the one remaining instrument to meet the crisis—broad Executive power to wage
 a war against the emergency, as great as the power that would be given to me if we
 were in fact invaded by a foreign foe...",,"In his First Inaugural Address on March 4, 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt expressed his belief that the only thing Americans had to fear was fear itself. He acknowledged the material hardships facing the nation, including unemployment and economic distress, but emphasized that the country's problems were not due to a lack of resources. Instead, he blamed the failure of those in charge of the economy for hoarding wealth and not putting it to productive use.
Roosevelt called for immediate action to address these issues, proposing that the government directly recruit workers and undertake projects to stimulate the economy. He also threatened to ask for broad executive power to wage a war against the economic crisis if the Congress failed to act. Overall, Roosevelt sought to instill confidence in the American people and encourage them to face their challenges with determination and courage.","In his inaugural address on March 4, 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt acknowledged the dire economic situation facing the United States, but emphasized that the nation's greatest enemy was not the economic crisis itself, but rather the fear and anxiety it inspired. He urged Americans to come together to address the crisis, which he attributed to the failure of the ""rulers of the exchange"" to manage the economy effectively. Roosevelt called for immediate action to put people to work, proposing a combination of government-led employment initiatives and infrastructure projects to stimulate economic growth. If Congress failed to act, he threatened to seek broad executive powers to address the crisis, likening it to a war effort. Throughout the speech, Roosevelt emphasized the importance of collective action and national unity in overcoming the challenges facing the country.","FDR asserts his firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is ""fear itself"" - the ""nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror"" that paralyzes efforts to address the nation's difficulties.
The nation faces common difficulties, primarily material in nature, with many Americans facing grim problems of existence and toiling with little return. This distress is not due to a failure of substance, as plenty is available but not being utilized effectively.
FDR declares that the nation demands action, and action now, to put people to work. This can be accomplished through direct government recruitment and employment on greatly needed projects.
If Congress fails to take such measures, FDR states he will seek broad executive power to wage a ""war against the emergency"" with the same authority as if the nation were invaded by a foreign foe.
The overall message is one of resolute determination to confront the nation's economic crisis head-on, with the only thing to truly fear being fear itself, which must be overcome through bold, immediate action."

Outside, the winter landscape is described as barren and inhospitable, with daisies beheaded by the frost.

 And yielded the sons of my stricken womb
 To the drum-beats of duty, the sabres of doom.

 Silent they sleep by the Persian waves,
 Scattered like shells on Egyptian sands,
 They lie with pale brows and brave, broken hands,
 They are strewn like blossoms mown down by chance
 On the blood-brown meadows of Flanders and France.

 Or compass the woe of the watch I keep?
 Or the pride that thrills thro' my heart's despair
 And the hope that comforts the anguish of prayer?
 And the far sad glorious vision I see
 Of the torn red banners of Victory?

 And life be refashioned on anvils of peace,
 And your love shall offer memorial thanks

 for the mare to be led from the field to the yard
 and the wind twisting his sideburns in its fingers.

 careful not to look her in the eye as he runs his hand
 the length of her neck, checking for dust on the lintels.

 like a man putting his shoulder to a knackered car,
 catches the hoof between his knees

 cups her fetlock and bends,
 a romantic lead dropping to the lips of his lover.

 excavating the arrow head of her frog,
 filing at the sole and branding on a shoe
 

 in an apparition of smoke,
 three nails gritted between his teeth,
 a seamstress pinning the dress of the bride.

 he gives her a slap and watches her leave,
 awkward in her new shoes, walking on strange ground.

The speaker encourages the reader to make time to experience this journey, especially in the autumn when the interplay of wind and light creates a dynamic, captivating natural landscape. The poem conveys a sense of the fleeting, transient nature of this experience, as the speaker notes that it is ""Useless to think you'll park and capture it / More thoroughly."" The poem suggests that being present in the moment and allowing oneself to be immersed in the sensory experience is more important than trying to fully document or preserve it."
"In the poem, Keats fights against his ulterior urge to create in order to indulge in one of his greatest passions: that of re-reading the play, King Lear, one of the most influential of all of Shakespeare's work. 'King Lear' is a play about family and misery, duty and birthright, and how one's opinion can lead to tragedy. It is one of Shakespeare's most revered plays, played constantly over the years to crowds of packed audiences; and it is no secret why the play itself is one of Keat's favourites. 'King Lear' is all about artifice and joy and misery, things that Keats himself saw echoed and repeated in his own life, and tried to echo and repeat in his own work.","Generate a short summary of On Sitting Down to Read King Lear Once Again by John Keats by John Keats: O golden-tongued Romance with serene lute!

 Shut up thine olden pages, and be mute:
 Adieu! for once again the fierce dispute,
 Betwixt damnation and impassion'd clay
 Must I burn through; once more humbly assay
 The bitter-sweet of this Shakespearian fruit.
 Chief Poet! and ye clouds of Albion,
 Begetters of our deep eternal theme,
 When through the old oak forest I am gone,
 Let me not wander in a barren dream,
 But when I am consumed in the fire,
 Give me new Phoenix wings to fly at my desire.",,"In ""On Sitting Down to Read King Lear Once Again,"" John Keats expresses his longing to read Shakespeare's tragic play once more, despite the emotional turmoil it brings. He addresses the Romance genre and the Muses, asking them to pause their melodies on this wintry day and let him delve into the bitter-sweet world of King Lear. Keats acknowledges the struggle between damnation and passion that the play presents and expresses his desire to understand the deep themes it explores. He also asks the poets of Albion to guide him through the experience and grant him new wings to fly once he has completed his journey through the play.","In this poem, John Keats reflects on his decision to re-read William Shakespeare's play ""King Lear"" once again. He addresses the play as a ""golden-tongued Romance"" and a ""Queen of far away"", urging it to ""be mute"" and leave him to his own thoughts. Keats acknowledges that re-reading the play will be a challenging and emotional experience, as it will require him to confront the themes of damnation and mortality. He asks the clouds of Albion (the land of Britain) to give him the strength and inspiration to persevere through this difficult task, and to grant him new creative wings to fly when he is eventually consumed by the passion and intensity of the play.","This poem by John Keats reflects on the experience of reading Shakespeare's play King Lear once again. Keats addresses ""Romance"" and the ""Siren"" of poetry, asking them to be silent so he can engage with the ""bitter-sweet"" of Shakespeare's work.

Keats expresses a desire to not merely wander in a ""barren dream"" after reading the play, but to be transformed, like the mythical Phoenix, and given new wings to soar with renewed inspiration."
"To Althea, from Prison' by Richard Lovelace describes a poet's attempts at maintaining his freedom while imprisoned in Gatehouse Prison in 1642. The poem begins with the speaker stating that while imprisoned in his cell his love comes to him and improves his situation. He imagines that his lover, Althea, visits him and takes his confinement away. His imaginings free him from the gates and grates which surround him. In the next section, he recalls moments of happiness drinking with others. These times brought him, and his friends, a freedom which was greater than that known by fish in the sea. They drink to the health of their king, a fact which contributed to the poet's imprisonment in the first place. In the last sections, he describes his ability to sing more shrilly than a “linnet.” This bird's song is not as sweet or loud as his is. His words will glorify the king and provide him with a freedom greater than that known by the winds which turn up a flood. The final lines return to the speaker's lover and he states that their love makes him freer than the angels which “soar” in the sky.","Generate a short summary of To Althea, from Prison by Richard Lovelace by Richard Lovelace: When Love with unconfinèd wings
 Hovers within my Gates,
 And my divine Althea brings
 To whisper at the Grates;
 When I lie tangled in her hair,
 And fettered to her eye,
 The Gods that wanton in the Air,
 Know no such Liberty.
 

 When flowing Cups run swiftly round
 With no allaying Thames,
 Our careless heads with Roses bound,
 Our hearts with Loyal Flames;
 When thirsty grief in Wine we steep,
 When Healths and draughts go free,
 Fishes that tipple in the Deep
 Know no such Liberty.
 

 When (like committed linnets) I
 With shriller throat shall sing
 The sweetness, Mercy, Majesty,
 And glories of my King;
 When I shall voice aloud how good
 He is, how Great should be,
 Enlargèd Winds, that curl the Flood,
 Know no such Liberty.
 

 Stone Walls do not a Prison make,
 Nor Iron bars a Cage;
 Minds innocent and quiet take
 That for an Hermitage.
 If I have freedom in my Love,
 And in my soul am free,
 Angels alone that soar above,
 Enjoy such Liberty.",,"""To Althea, from Prison"" is a poem by Richard Lovelace that explores the concept of freedom and love. The speaker expresses that even though he is in prison, his love for Althea and his devotion to his king give him a sense of freedom. He asserts that physical barriers like stone walls and iron bars do not confine the mind or soul. The poem celebrates the power of love and devotion to transcend physical limitations. The final stanza emphasizes that true freedom lies in the mind and soul, and even in prison, one can find liberty through love and devotion.","The poem is a love letter from prison, where the speaker is confined but finds freedom in his love for Althea. He describes the joy and beauty of their love, even in the midst of his confinement. He argues that true freedom is not physical, but rather the freedom of the mind and soul, which he has found in his love for Althea. The poem concludes by stating that even in prison, the speaker's love for Althea is his true freedom, and that only angels who soar above can truly know the same kind of liberty.","The poem ""To Althea, from Prison"" by Richard Lovelace explores the idea of true freedom. Despite being physically confined in prison, the speaker finds freedom through his love for Althea, his devotion to the king, and the liberty of the mind. The poem contrasts the speaker's inner freedom with the limited freedom of those who are physically unconfined, such as the gods, fish, and winds. The central message is that true freedom lies not in external circumstances, but in the human spirit and one's state of mind."
"The first thing, and also last thing, Williams focuses on within this poem is the atmosphere. The keywords from this descriptive field are 'rain', 'lights', 'rumbling', and 'dark city'. The description of the scene, although short, is a sensory overload. Williams hastens to fit in as many sights and sounds as he can during the 31 lines. By setting the poem within this rainy, dark city, the poem takes on an air of nostalgia. By not identifying the city, the reader can self-identify with the poem, reading it into a location of their choosing. Without the appearance of the firetruck, the scene is actually a little depressing. The focus on the 'rain' and 'dark' culminate into a dingy and washed-out image. The sudden appearance of the truck breathes life into the poem, searing itself on the memory of the reader. The lack of sound within the city is also evident by the appearance of the truck. The onomatopoeic 'siren howls' and 'wheels rumbling' culminate together to slice through the silence of the city. This moment, although only a flash is one that sensorially captivates the reader. The flash of 'red' and 'gold', searing as an image accompanying the loudness of the firetruck. This moment is temporary, yet very impactful. Perhaps here Williams is reflecting on the idea of memory, with this seemingly insignificant moment creating such a powerful image. This is supported by the odd elements which William writes, especially that of the number '5' seared onto his brain. It does not always have to be magnificent which is solidified in memory. Speed Movement is one of the key facets of 'The Great Figure.' The slow steadiness of the 'rain' and 'light' beginning the poem is contrasted against the sudden disruption of the firetruck. Interestingly, 'moving' is one of the only words in the poem that has a line to itself, elevating its importance. The fleeting nature of the firetruck can be linked to the transitory nature of time. This moment of explosive action speeds past us and then is gone. The firetruck comes into, and out of, sight in the blink of an eye. Williams could be suggesting that the fleeting nature of life needs to be focused on. Moments happen and then they are gone, most lost to forgetting. Perhaps William urges the reader to be more present, find the extraordinary within the ordinary.","Generate a short summary of The Great Figure by William Carlos Williams by William Carlos Williams: Among the rain

"Amends' by Adrienne Rich describes the purity of moonlight as it passes over, and soaks into, the face of the earth. The speaker begins by describing the purity of the moon's light and how on certain nights it is more meaningful than others. The night of this poem's telling is one such night. The light emerges from behind an apple tree, crosses the ocean, pauses for a moment on the sand of the shore, relishing in the solidity of the earth, and then begins to climb. The moonlight moves up a cliff face and then comes into contact with humanity. It is forced to travel through gash-like “quarries” and across the vast piles of waste humankind has discarded. It finally reaches the population of the earth and rests of the eyelids of all the sleepers, hoping to “amend” the actions of humanity. The purity of light is being wielded as a weapon for the good of the earth.","Generate a short summary of Amends by Adrienne Rich by Adrienne Rich: Nights like this: on the cold apple bough

"Orinda to Lucasia' by Katherine Philips describes the importance and intensity of the relationship she holds with her close friend, Anne Owens. The poem begins with the speaker describing what the world is like when it waits for the sun to rise. The night seems endless and the sun late to arrive in the sky. This intense wanting of light inspires the birds to cry out to the sky and the flowers to droop in sadness. Even the brook which should be fierce is mourning for the sun. The second stanza is directly related to the first as the speaker compares her friendship with Anne Owens to the sun. Owens, referred to as Lucasia in this text, is as critical to her survival as heat and light are to birds and flowers. For an unstated reason, the speaker and her friend are separated at this point and she knows she won't survive much longer without her. Even though it might be fruitless, she will continue to cry out, like the desperate birds of the first stanza, for Lucasia to return to her.","Generate a short summary of Orinda to Lucasia by Katherine Philips by Katherine Philips: Observe the weary birds e're night be done,
 How they would fain call up the tardy Sun,
 With Feathers hung with dew,
 And trembling voices too,
 They court their glorious Planet to appear,
 That they may find recruits of spirits there.
 The drooping flowers hang their heads,
 And languish down into their beds:
 While Brooks more bold and fierce than they,
 Wanting those beams, from whence
 All things drink influence,
 Openly murmur and demand the day.
 Thou my Lucasia art far more to me,
 Than he to all the under-world can be;
 From thee I've heat and light,
 Thy absence makes my night.
 But ah! my Friend, it now grows very long,
 The sadness weighty, and the darkness strong:
 My tears (its dew) dwell on my cheeks,
 And still my heart thy dawning seeks,
 And to thee mournfully it cries,
 That if too long I wait,
 Ev'n thou may'st come too late,
 And not restore my life, but close my eyes.

"The poem, Reminiscence, by Elizabeth Jennings is about experiencing love in childhood and adulthood. As the very title of the poem suggests itself that it is about the nostalgic feeling of childhood. The poet, comparing her childhood with the adulthood, says that her childhood was honest and innocent. Love in her childhood was neither complicated nor violently emotional. Remembering her childhood, the poet says that she could live her life as she wished.
 

 On the contrary, her adulthood introduces her to the stony world which asks for meanings of everything. She says where her childhood was full of glittering life; her adulthood taught her about the clarity of life. She says where in her childhood she never felt to understand the meaning of love and other things, her adulthood taught her the reality of life, but she says she doesn’t need such clarity.","Generate a short summary of Reminiscence by Elizabeth Jennings by Elizabeth Jennings: When I was happy alone, too young for love

 To fret at thought or even try to whittle
 A pattern from the shapeless stony stuff
 That now confuses since I’ve grown too subtle.

 Something they could not touch, made numb with fear;
 I felt the glittering landscape in the mind

"Democracy' by Langston Hughes is a direct and powerful poem that asks the reader to reassess their ideas about freedom and democracy. In the short lines of this poem, the speaker makes the argument that they deserve to be free and “stand” on the “land” as much as “you” do. They have thus far been denied equal rights but it's time for things to change. Incremental change, he adds, or the promise of change in the future is not enough. He and all those in the Black community (or anyone who has been disenfranchised for that matter) want and deserve the same rights as those in power.","Generate a short summary of Democracy by Langston Hughes by Langston Hughes: Democracy will not come

"Autumn Fires' by Robert Louis Stevenson is a straightforward, celebratory poem that compares autumn colors to a raging wildfire. In this short poem's stanzas, Stevenson celebrates the changes that come as the autumn season begins. All around the landscape, he can see the red fires of changing leaves burning.

"In The Bazaars of Hyderabad' by Sarojini Naidu describes in vibrant detail the market stalls and products of the Hyderabad bazaars. The poem begins with the speaker, a customer, asking a vendor what he is selling. This person gives him details regarding the turbans, rich mirrors, and daggers, as well as beautifully stitched tunics he has for sale. The text progresses quickly to the next stall where the same, or possibly a new, customer inquiries about the “lentils, rice” and spices being sold. Again, they receive an appealing description of the items. In the third stanza, the speaker becomes interested in what the “goldsmith” is making. This stanza is more in-depth as the goldsmith focuses on three different ways he treats gold. He is seeking to show off his products and his skill. He can hammer something thin enough for the leg of a pigeon, or forge something sturdy enough for a king. In the fourth stanza, the speaker inquires about three different types of instruments and fruits. These products almost all originate from the Indian subcontinent and are added into the piece in order to further praise the Indian culture. The final stanza describes in greater detail than any of the previous stanzas what the materials for sale are going to be used for. In this section, the speaker asks “flower-girls” what they are weaving. They respond by describing the creation of a crown for a bridegroom and a shroud for someone recently deceased.

"In this famous poem, We Alone, based on humanity, love, and money, Alice Walker reveals the power within each human heart, and the power we have together when united in purpose. She begins We Alone with a strong statement and one that makes the reader stop and ponders the power of the human race. With these lines of We Alone, the speaker communicates to the reader that these musings are a possibility if only everyone would agree to act. The speaker claims that it “could be our revolution” to end the struggle for money and power and begin to value moments of connections with nature and other human beings. The speaker finally expresses a final thought on all that humankind values. She reveals that the revolution could finally happen when people would learn “to love what is plentiful as much as what is scarce”. Thus the speaker presents the idea that human love is what is behind the way the world works. Because we love power and material wealth, we place value on what is rare. However, if we could together agree to love all that nature has to offer, whether scarce or plentiful, we would surely enjoy a more thorough life. Although the reality of this kind of shift taking place is nearly impossible, the words do cause the reader to venture into self reflection and to ponder what true value is. The reader is moved to question his own motives and values as they determine the course of his life.","Generate a short summary of We Alone by Alice Walker by Alice Walker: We alone can devalue gold by not caring if it falls or rises in the marketplace. Wherever there is gold there is a chain, you know, and if your chain is gold so much the worse for you. Feathers, shells and sea-shaped stones are all as rare. This could be our revolution: to love what is plentiful as much as what's scarce.",,"""We Alone"" is a poem by Alice Walker from her collection ""Horses Make a Landscape Look More Beautiful."" In this poem, Walker explores the idea that the value of things, such as gold, is not inherent but rather depends on human perception and desire. She suggests that the true revolution could be in appreciating and loving what is plentiful, just as much as what is scarce. The poem encourages readers to look beyond material wealth and find value in the natural world and simple things around us.","In ""We Alone"" by Alice Walker, she reflects on the value we place on material possessions, particularly gold. She argues that we have the power to devalue gold by not being swayed by its market fluctuations, and that our attachment to it can be a form of bondage. Walker suggests that instead of coveting rare and scarce things, we should learn to appreciate and love what is plentiful and abundant. This idea can be seen as a metaphor for a revolution in our values and priorities, where we shift our focus from material wealth to a deeper appreciation for the simple things in life.","The passage emphasizes the idea that we have the power to devalue the perceived value of gold by not caring about its fluctuations in the market. It suggests that wherever there is gold, there is also a chain that binds people.

The central message is that our ""revolution"" could be to love and appreciate the abundance around us just as much as the scarce and valuable."
"Landscape with the Fall of Icarus' by William Carlos Williams gives the reader a humanly dark description of a painting by Pieter Brueghel. The poem being with the speaker stating that it was spring in which Icarus fell. The season is depicted by Pieter Brueghel through the trees, the ploughing farmer, and the color choices. Williams takes the season and plays with the “pageantry” of everything associated with it. There are people working, all to the benefit of themselves. In the next lines, he draws a reader's attention to another part of the scene. The young man, Icarus, has flown too close to the sun and is now drowning in the bay. Although this is clearly a tragedy for his father, and for the man himself, no one notices. This is why in the final lines Williams refers to the death as “unsignificant.”","Generate a short summary of Landscape with the Fall of Icarus by William Carlos Williams by William Carlos Williams: According to Brueghel

The poem describes the indifference of nature to Icarus' fall from the sky. While Icarus is dying unnoticed off the coast, the farmer is plowing his field, and the year is in full bloom, concerned with its own renewal. The poem emphasizes the insignificance of Icarus' demise in the grand scheme of the natural world.","In ""Landscape with the Fall of Icarus"" by William Carlos Williams, the poet reflects on the famous myth of Icarus, who flew too close to the sun and fell to his death. However, Williams' poem does not focus on the tragic event itself, but rather on the mundane scene that unfolded around it. The poem describes a farmer ploughing his field on a spring day, surrounded by the vibrant colors and sounds of nature. Meanwhile, Icarus falls into the sea, his death going unnoticed by the farmer and the other creatures in the landscape. The poem highlights the contrast between the grand, mythological event and the ordinary, everyday world, suggesting that even the most extraordinary events can be overshadowed by the routine of life.","The poem describes a pastoral scene where a farmer is plowing his field, oblivious to the tragic event unfolding nearby. While the ""whole pageantry of the year"" is alive and vibrant, the drowning of Icarus, the mythological figure who flew too close to the sun, goes unnoticed.

"The poem “Amulet” is full of cues that predominantly appeal to one's sight. Starting from the inside of the wolf's fang which is purple as heather. The inside of the heather looks like the wolf's fur. The inside of the wolf's fur is reminiscent of the old and grotesque forest resembling the wolf's foot. Its foot, in turn, calls for a comparison to the stony horizon (marks the path of the wolf that it has to tread along until it chances upon its prey in a doe), for the wolf's foot is as hard as stone (Thanks to the long walks!). The stony horizon besides looking like the foot also looks like the tongue of the wolf. Its tongue is as hard as stone (this is one hungry wolf!). The wolf's tongue salivating looks much like the doe's tears. And the doe's tears are hard like the frozen swamp (wolf sure won't fall for tears and won't give up on treating itself to a doe dinner!). The frozen swamp, suggestive of the wolf's inconsiderate and cold attitude, has in it the doe's tears. The blood only next to the attitude of the wolf is chilled. It is chilled by the snow wind as the wolf marches through its habitat for food. As its walk progresses, the wolf looks at the North star hoping it would guide him to his next prey. As he looks at the star one could see his eyes gleam like the star. It may be just a reflection of the star on the eyes of the wolf or it could be the passion of the wolf accelerated by its appetite. Like the wolf's eye reflects the North star, the star has inside it, the wolf's fang.","Generate a short summary of Amulet by Ted Hughes by Ted Hughes: Inside the wolf’s fang, the mountain of heather.

The poem describes a journey inside the wolf, from its fang to the North star and back, revealing various elements of nature such as heather, forest, tears, swamp, snow wind, and the North star. The journey seems to suggest a cycle or interconnectedness of these natural elements, with each one leading to the next.","The poem ""Amulet"" by Ted Hughes is a mystical and symbolic exploration of the natural world and the interconnectedness of all living things. The poem begins by describing the wolf's fang, which contains the mountain of heather, and then delves deeper into the wolf's fur, the ragged forest, and the stony horizon, ultimately reaching the North star. Along the way, the poem touches on themes of transformation, cyclical renewal, and the eternal connection between the natural world and the human experience.","This poem by Ted Hughes, ""Amulet,"" uses a series of nested images to explore the interconnectedness of the natural world. The poem begins with the wolf's fang and then moves inward, layer by layer, through various elements of the landscape and the wolf's body, until finally arriving back at the wolf's fang. This cyclical structure suggests the continuous, interdependent nature of the natural world. The vivid, evocative imagery creates a sense of the wolf's power and the wild, untamed beauty of the natural environment."
"The Sacred' by Stephen Dunn describes a conversation in a classroom and the idea of a car as a place of spiritual peace. The speaker takes the reader through the simple elements of a discussion about sacred places. The best example that a student in this discussion could come up with was a car. In it, one can insert the key, worship at the altar-dashboard, and put themselves in motion to go wherever they want to. This depiction of the car felt truthful to all those in the room and no one could fault it.","Generate a short summary of The Sacred by Stephen Dunn by Stephen Dunn: After the teacher asked if anyone had

Alone in the vehicle with his chosen music playing, he finds solace and freedom from the need to speak or answer. The car becomes a symbol of escape and personal sanctuary for him, and the image of the car in motion resonates with several students, who share their own hidden places but keep returning to the idea of being in a car.","In ""The Sacred"" by Stephen Dunn, a teacher asks a class of students if they have a ""sacred place"" where they feel comfortable and alone. One student, who appears to be the most serious and introspective, reveals that his sacred place is his car, where he can play his favorite music and be by himself. The other students begin to share their own sacred places, such as their rooms or hiding spots, but the car remains a recurring theme. The poem explores the idea that the car provides a sense of freedom and escape, allowing the speaker to leave behind the need to communicate or conform to societal expectations. The ""bright altar of the dashboard"" and the act of putting the key in the ignition become symbols of the speaker's desire for solitude and autonomy.","The poem ""The Sacred"" by Stephen Dunn explores the idea of finding a sense of sacredness or refuge in the solitude and personal space of a car.

"‘Richard Cory’ is a poem that shows why we should not judge people on appearances as it subverts our expectations in the final line. Regarding the structure and form, the poem is written in four quatrains written in iambic pentameter with a simple ABAB rhyme scheme. The language is straightforward though quietly stirring. The fact that the rhythm and rhyme are so consistent throughout makes the revelation at the end of stanza four all the more shocking. There is almost a conversational tone to the poem. The frequent use of ‘and’ adds to this effect, loading detail upon detail as the speaker tells the sorry tale of Richard Cory.","Generate a short summary of Richard Cory by Edwin Arlington Robinson by Edwin Arlington Robinson: Whenever Richard Cory went down town,
 We people on the pavement looked at him:

 And he was always human when he talked,
 But still he fluttered pulses when he said,
 ""Good-morning,"" and he glittered when he walked.
 

 And he was rich--yes, richer than a king--
 And admirably schooled in every grace:
 In fine, we thought that he was everything
 To make us wish that we were in his place.

 And went without the meat and cursed the bread;
 And Richard Cory, one calm summer night,
 Went home and put a bullet through his head.

The townspeople are drawn to his refined appearance, mannerisms, and wealth, and they often wish they could be in his place. However, the poem takes a dark turn when it reveals that Richard Cory has taken his own life, suggesting that even with all his material possessions and social status, he was still unhappy and unfulfilled.

"Breakfast' by Jacques Prévert is a thoughtful and direct poem that describes a speaker's reactions to an unknown man's coffee, cigarette, and departure.

"Killers' by Carl Sandburg describes and decries the role of sixteen million, idealized men chosen to fight, kill, and die for a cause. The poem begins with the speaker asking that his listener pay attention to the “song” he is about to share. This simply refers to the text of the poem which is about to follow. The speaker states that his words are going to depict a world that is deeply depressing, angry, and restricting.He is going to be telling the story of men who were selected for their strength and sent to kill and die on the battlefield. Their “young” blood flowed into the earth as they caused the deaths of others. It quickly becomes clear the speaker does not agree with war, or at least this particular conflict. That being said, he still realizes the men had homes and families. They once had dreams and “games.” In the final lines, he explains that the men remain in his memory because he too was there. He still remembers the trenches, the smells, and the sounds that meant men were about to die or had already.","Generate a short summary of Killers by Carl Sandburg by Carl Sandburg: I AM singing to you
 Soft as a man with a dead child speaks;
 Hard as a man in handcuffs,
 Held where he cannot move:
 Under the sun
 Are sixteen million men,
 Chosen for shining teeth,
 Sharp eyes, hard legs,
 And a running of young warm blood in their wrists.
 And a red juice runs on the green grass;
 And a red juice soaks the dark soil.
 And the sixteen million are killing. . . and killing
 and killing.
 I never forget them day or night:
 They beat on my head for memory of them;
 They pound on my heart and I cry back to them,
 To their homes and women, dreams and games.
 I wake in the night and smell the trenches,
 And hear the low stir of sleepers in lines--
 Sixteen million sleepers and pickets in the dark:
 Some of them long sleepers for always,
 Some of them tumbling to sleep to-morrow for always,
 Fixed in the drag of the world's heartbreak,
 Eating and drinking, toiling. . . on a long job of
 killing.

 His love had kindled in the dark.
 

 His two hands were curved apart
 In the semblance of a heart.

 A bare heart on his hidden one,

 No son awake could bear to know.

 Too tender for the day to trace.

"“The Housewife” by Charlotte Anna Perkins Gilman describes the day to day life of a housewife and the circular, unchanging elements of that life.

She has the house, her children, and her husband, her “lord” that is in charge of all she is.

They are there no matter what she does and her children and husband are always there to re-solidify them if she ever feels like she could escape. The Housewife continues on to speak on the type of life that the speaker lives and the things that she is allowed to occupy herself with. She can worry about what the family will eat, wear, and how she is to lavish the most praise and love that she can. Beyond that is not her purview. In the final stanza, she states that above all else the most important goal a housewife can hope for is to cover the Earth in children.","Generate a short summary of The Housewife by Charlotte Anna Perkins Gilman by Charlotte Anna Perkins Gilman: Here is the House to hold me — cradle of all the race;

 Here for the hours of the day and the hours of the night;
 Bound with the bands of Duty, rivetted tight;
 Duty older than Adam — Duty that saw
 Acceptance utter and hopeless in the eyes of the serving squaw.
 

 Food and the serving of food — that is my daylong care;
 What and when we shall eat, what and how we shall wear;
 Soiling and cleaning of things — that is my task in the main —
 Soil them and clean them and soil them — soil them and clean them again.
 

 To work at my trade by the dozen and never a trade to know;
 To plan like a Chinese puzzle — fitting and changing so;
 To think of a thousand details, each in a thousand ways;
 For my own immediate people and a possible love and praise.

 Useful, commonplace, private — simply a small back-yard;

"spring again focuses on the Spring season of one year, with the characters in the poem filling time while waiting for Summer to come. It at once stresses how slow time passes, and how quickly the seasons can change. This focus on the progression of time demonstrates that although some moments are slow and some are fast, time never stops moving. The poem interacts with characters from the city, focusing on activities that the 'junkies' and 'ghetto musicians' do to pass the time within spring. For a poem which is addressing Spring, there is very little imagery of nature, instead of focusing more on the city and its occupants. There is certain melancholia within the poem, the people described being unable to change or escape their circumstances, stuck in a cycle of waiting for the next season forever.","Generate a short summary of spring again by Jesús Papoleto Meléndez by Jesús Papoleto Meléndez: spring came /

"Vultures' by Chinua Achebe describes the vultures in such a disparaging and grim fashion that could be construed as a metaphor for the people responsible for the atrocities in Belsen and in particular the “Commandant”. The first stanza is the longest part of the poem and it is not a coincidence. It is a metaphor for the commandant's predominant personality traits and this is why it dominates so much of the poem's content. In the third stanza, the scene with his child represents a far smaller portion of the poem and this is a metaphor for his spark of humanity. The form of this piece is very clever as it creates a grim image, creates a glimmer of hope in the second and third stanzas, and then ends on a dour note emphasizing the futility of the situation.","Generate a short summary of Vultures by Chinua Achebe by Chinua Achebe: In the greyness

 mate his smooth
 bashed-in head, a pebble
 on a stem rooted in
 a dump of gross
 feathers, inclined affectionately
 to hers. Yesterday they picked
 the eyes of a swollen
 corpse in a water-logged
 trench and ate the things in its bowel. Full
 gorged they chose their roost
 keeping the hollowed remnant
 in easy range of cold
 telescopic eyes ...
 

 

 Strange
 indeed how love in other
 ways so particular
 will pick a corner
 in that charnel-house
 tidy it and coil up there, perhaps
 even fall asleep - her face
 turned to the wall!

 Camp going home for
 the day with fumes of
 human roast clinging
 rebelliously to his hairy
 nostrils will stop
 at the wayside sweet-shop
 and pick up a chocolate
 for his tender offspring
 waiting at home for Daddy's return ...

The poem opens with a vulture perched on a dead tree, having fed on a corpse the previous day, yet showing affection towards its mate. The scene is described as a ""charnel-house,"" yet love finds a way to exist and even thrive in this environment.
The poem then makes a comparison to the Commandant at Belsen Camp, who, despite the horrors he has witnessed and been a part of, can still find tenderness and love for his family. The poem ends with a reflection on the complexities of love, suggesting that even in the most cruel hearts, there exists a capacity for tenderness and love. The poem ultimately asks the reader to consider the paradoxical nature of love and its ability to exist even in the darkest of places.","In ""Vultures"" by Chinua Achebe, the poem explores the theme of love and its coexistence with cruelty and evil.

The poem then shifts its focus to a Commandant at a concentration camp, who despite being surrounded by death and suffering, still shows tenderness towards his family. The poem suggests that even the most cruel and evil individuals can have a spark of love within them, which can perpetuate evil. The poem ultimately concludes that love and evil are intertwined, and that even the smallest germ of love can lead to the perpetuation of evil.","The poem ""Vultures"" by Chinua Achebe explores the duality of human nature, contrasting the seemingly heartless and cruel actions of vultures with the capacity for tenderness and love, even in the most unlikely of individuals. The poem describes a pair of vultures perched on a dead tree, their ""smooth bashed-in heads"" and ""gross feathers"" suggesting their gruesome feeding habits. Yet, the poet observes that even these scavengers exhibit a form of affection towards each other. The poem then draws a parallel between the vultures' behavior and that of a Nazi commandant, who, despite the atrocities he has committed, is still capable of showing kindness to his own child. The poem suggests that the capacity for both cruelty and compassion coexists within the human condition, and that even the most monstrous individuals may harbor a ""tiny glow-worm tenderness"" within their ""icy caverns of a cruel heart."""
"Farther' by Owen Sheers describes a trek up Skirrid Hill which Sheers and his father take on the 27th of December. This poem begins with a clear setting and location, December 27th, on Skirrid Hill. The two characters in the poem, the son, who is the speaker, and the father, in an attempt to become closer, are repeating an activity they must have once found enjoyable, climbing Skirrid Hill. The men do not seem to commune as they progress up the mountain but are consumed in their worlds. The climb is treacherous, but no one is hurt, the ground is steeper than they expected, but they make it to a resting spot. An altar that is “split…by a father's grief / at the loss of his son to man.” This is the reader's first hint as to why the two have grown apart. The son is aging, becoming his own man and the father does not know how to communicate with him anymore. As they continue to climb up the hill the son looks back at his father and can feel how he is breathing and connect those feelings to his own. This is a clue that the two are becoming more similar and this is what is taking them apart. They eventually make it to the top of the mountain and pose for a photo the son sets up. The son is seeking evidence or some kind of proof that they were here, that they did try to fix things. He hopes at this moment that they have made some kind of progress in improving their relationship, but that doesn't seem to be the case.","Generate a short summary of Farther by Owen Sheers by Owen Sheers: I don’t know if the day after Boxing Day has a name

 We stopped there at an altar of rock and rested,
 watching the dog shrink over the hill before continuing ourselves,
 finding the slope steeper than expected.
 A blade of wind from the east
 and the broken stone giving under our feet

 Half way up and I turned to look at you,
 your bent head the colour of the rocks,
 your breath reaching me, short and sharp and solitary,
 and again I felt the tipping in the scales of us,
 the intersection of our ages.

 and you are with me again, so together we climbed to the top
 and shared the shock of a country unrolled before us,
 the hedged fields breaking on the edge of Wales.
 Pulling a camera from my pocket I placed it on the trig point
 and leant my cheek against the stone to find you in its frame,
 before joining you and waiting for the shutter’s blink
 that would tell me I had caught this:
 the sky rubbed raw over the mountains,
 us standing on the edge of the world, together against the view

"‘The Sick Rose’ by William Blake describes the loss of a woman’s virginity through the metaphor of a rose and an invisible worm. The poem begins with the speaker telling the rose that she is sick. This sickness is caused by the “invisible worm.” The phallic-shaped worm comes to the rose at night in the middle of “the howling storm.” There is a real sense of danger and dread in these lines that only builds as the poem progresses and Blake makes use of enjambment. In the second stanza of ‘The Sick Rose,’ the worm finds the rose’s bed. The rose is afflicted with the worm’s “dark secret love” and has its life destroyed.

"‘After Auschwitz’ is six stanzas long with stanzas numbering 8, 2, 8, 2, 12, 1 and there is no rhyme scheme. The poem is a reaction piece, written by a speaker that is filled with anger over the atrocities committed by the Nazis, and more specifically man, during the holocaust. She speaks about her anger, and how it fills her daily; that death does not care about what’s happening and does not take those who really deserve it.
 

 She spends the rest of the poem passing judgment on these men, deciding that they should no longer be worshiped like “temples” or have any agency in their own lives, all in an attempt to stop something like this from happening again. The speaker ends the poem by hoping that God has not heard all she has said allowed, perhaps fearing she is becoming like the men she condemns.","Generate a short summary of After Auschwitz by Anne Sexton by Anne Sexton: Anger,

 in his frying pan.
 

 And death looks on with a casual eye

The poem describes the Nazis taking infants and cooking them for breakfast, with death observing indifferently.

She denies man the ability to create or appreciate beauty, reducing him to an outhouse and cursing him from performing simple daily tasks.

The speaker's anger is so intense that they declare that humans should never again engage in activities such as drinking tea, writing books, or even raising their eyes to the sky. The poem is a powerful expression of grief, anger, and moral indignation in the face of unimaginable human suffering.","This poem by Anne Sexton expresses intense anger and disgust towards humanity in the wake of the atrocities of the Holocaust.

"Tell Me a Story' by Robert Penn Warren describes how the speaker distances himself from the modern world as it left nothing for a person like him. This poem is divided into two parts. In the first part, the speaker shares one of his childhood memories. One day, he was in his native place in Kentucky. There he stood by a road in utter darkness. The sky was dark due to the absence of the moon as well as the stars. He only heard the sound of geese migrating northwards. In the next part, the speaker asks readers to tell him a story. Before they can start, he defines what should be the theme of the tale. It must encompass the theme of distances. In modernity, there is nothing left to be talked about. That's why he tells them to share a story that can rejuvenate his weary mind. It should be a story of delight, not filled with the ravages of modern time.","Generate a short summary of Tell Me a Story by Robert Penn Warren by Robert Penn Warren: [ A ]

"Cargoes' by John Masefield is an interesting poem about the history of cargo ships and the cargo that they transported. In the first stanza, the poet explores ancient ships and ports from the Bible and the various items they could've been transported from Ophir. These include apes, peacocks, and sandalwood. The second stanza brings in a Spanish galleon and the gemstones this particular type of ship would've carried. These two different periods in history are juxtaposed with one another as well as with the final.

"Dunn's 'Before We Leave' explores a journey, it is at once a metaphorical journey to happiness and also a real one, that you must 'wear hiking boots for'. The poet begins by listing things that we must bring on the journey, building immersion into the metaphor before actually launching into it. This journey, it is revealed, is to self-satisfaction, happiness, and avoiding the 'abyss' of depression. It is not an easy journey to take, with Dunn's narrative weaving in and out of metaphor and the literal, the confusion adding a layer to the journey itself.","Generate a short summary of Before We Leave by Stephen Dunn by Stephen Dunn: Just so it’s clear—
 no whining on the journey.
 If you whine, you’ll get stuck
 somewhere with people
 like yourself. It’s an unwritten law.
 Wear hiking boots. Pack food
 and a change of clothes.
 We go slowly. Endurance won’t
 be enough, though without it
 you can’t get to the place
 where more of you is asked.
 Expect there will be times
 when you’ll be afraid.
 Hold hands and tremble together
 if you must but remember
 each of you is alone.
 

 Where are we going?
 It’s not an issue of here or there.
 And if you ever feel you can’t
 take another step imagine
 how you might feel to arrive,
 if not wiser, a little more aware
 how to inhabit the middle ground
 between misery and joy.
 Trudge on. In the higher regions,
 where the footing is unsure,
 to trudge is to survive.
 

 Happiness is another journey,
 almost over before it starts,
 guaranteed to disappoint.
 If you’ve come for it, say so,
 you’ll get your money back.
 I hope you all realize that anytime
 is a fine time to laugh. Fake it,
 however, and false laughter
 will accompany you like a cowbell
 for the rest of your days.
 You’ll forever lack the seriousness
 of a clown. At some point
 the rocks will be jagged,
 the precipice sheer. That won’t be
 the abyss you’ll see looking down.
 The abyss, you’ll discover
 (if you’ve made it this far),
 is usually nearer than that—
 at the bottom of something
 you’ve yet to resolve,
 or posing as your confidante.

 say such things, and mean both.",,"""Before We Leave"" by Stephen Dunn is a poetic reflection on a journey, both literal and metaphorical.

Throughout the journey, the speaker offers advice, encouragement, and warnings, emphasizing the importance of self-reliance and acceptance of the unknown.","This poem, ""Before We Leave"" by Stephen Dunn, is a thought-provoking and introspective piece that explores the themes of journey, growth, and self-awareness.

"Relic' by Ted Hughes presents the “jawbone” as a relic of the sea. In the end, the poet constructs a metaphorical “cenotaph” with it. 'Relic' by Ted Hughes revolves around the “jawbone” that the poetic persona has found from the seashore. After gripping it in his hand, he looks around and comes across “crabs” and “dogfish” lying dead on the shore. The scene depicts the cruelty of the sea that topples lives. In the second stanza, the poet thinks about the jaw that he is holding. The jaw was active at a time but now it's of no use. Here on the shore, it lies with shells, skulls, claws, and other useless things. In the last stanza, referring to the cruelty of the sea again the poet, at last, portrays that the jawbone in his hand “is now cenotaph”. As the poet writes about it and makes this useless piece of bone a lifetime existence in his poem.","Generate a short summary of Relic by Ted Hughes by Ted Hughes: I found this jawbone at the sea's edge:

 In that darkness camaraderie does not hold.
 Nothing touches but, clutching, devours. And the jaws,
 Before they are satisfied or their stretched purpose
 Slacken, go down jaws; go gnawn bare. Jaws
 Eat and are finished and the jawbone comes to the beach:
 This is the sea's achievement; with shells,
 Verterbrae, claws, carapaces, skulls.

 Indigestibles, the spars of purposes

"what if a much of a which of a wind' by E.E. Cummings speaks on the destruction of the earth and the risk humankind poses to itself. The poem takes the reader through a series of three disasters. The first two are related to naturally occurring events, a tornado, and a blizzard.

The first stanza describes a wind that challenges the summer's illusion, disrupting the order of the universe. It brings truth to lies, changes the positions of the sun, stars, and even kings and queens.
The second stanza introduces a wind that brings winter, turning hope to terror and sight to blindness. It strangles valleys and stifles forests, leaving only those with the deepest roots and strongest hearts to welcome the spring.
The third stanza contemplates the possibility of a wind that could split the universe in two, bringing an end to everything and yet, paradoxically, allowing for the continuation of life. It encourages embracing the present moment and the cyclical nature of existence.","In this poem, E.E. Cummings explores the idea of the power of wind and its potential to disrupt and transform the world. The poem is divided into three sections, each of which imagines a different scenario in which the wind has a profound impact on the natural world and human existence.
In the first section, the wind is depicted as giving truth to the summer's lie, suggesting that it has the power to reveal the truth behind the beauty and tranquility of the summer. The wind is also described as ""bloodying"" the sun and ""yanking"" the stars out of their course, implying a sense of chaos and disorder.
In the second section, the wind is depicted as a force that can bring about destruction and chaos, ""flaying"" hills with sleet and snow, ""strangling"" valleys, and ""stifling"" forests. Despite this, the poem suggests that even in the midst of destruction, there is still hope and the possibility of rebirth, as the ""hearts are mountains, roots are trees"" and they will ""cry hello to the spring"".
In the final section, the poem imagines a scenario in which the wind has the power to bring about the end of the universe, ""biting it in two"" and ""peeling"" it out of its grave. Despite this, the poem suggests that even in the face of destruction, there is still a sense of continuity and connection, as ""all nothing's only our hugest home"" and ""the most who die, the more we live"".
Throughout the poem, Cummings uses his characteristic unconventional syntax and punctuation to create a sense of urgency and intensity, emphasizing the power and transformative potential of the wind.","The poem ""what if a much of a which of a wind"" by E.E.

"Diary of a Church Mouse' by John Betjeman is a satirical look, through the eyes of a mouse, at the relationship humans have with their church. The poem comes from the perspective of a church mouse. This creature lives every day of the year within the confines of the church. He's often alone and starving, but he does not move anywhere else. He likes the church and is devoted to living there. He speaks about the different feasts that humans get to engage in and how they don't benefit him at all. But, there is one feast that is different. That is the Harvest Festival. When the church is filled with corn, wheat, gourds, and more, he's able to nibble and munch on these items until he's full. But, there's a catch. At this time of year, the church is invaded by other creatures, mice, and rats, that want to take advantage of this plethora of food. The speaker is clearly irritated by this fact and reminds the reader that he never goes into the fields of other mice and eats their food. They are well sustained all through the year and he isn't. The mice that come into the church once a year are compared to the human beings that do the same. He judges these mice for their selective attendance and is at the same time alluding to that same feature in human churchgoers.","Generate a short summary of Diary of a Church Mouse by John Betjeman by John Betjeman: Here among long-discarded cassocks,
 Damp stools, and half-split open hassocks,
 Here where the vicar never looks
 I nibble through old service books.
 Lean and alone I spend my days
 Behind this Church of England baize.
 I share my dark forgotten room
 With two oil-lamps and half a broom.
 The cleaner never bothers me,
 So here I eat my frugal tea.
 My bread is sawdust mixed with straw;
 My jam is polish for the floor.
 Christmas and Easter may be feasts
 For congregations and for priests,
 And so may Whitsun. All the same,
 They do not fill my meagre frame.
 For me the only feast at all
 Is Autumn's Harvest Festival,
 When I can satisfy my want
 With ears of corn around the font.
 I climb the eagle's brazen head
 To burrow through a loaf of bread.
 I scramble up the pulpit stair
 And gnaw the marrows hanging there.
 It is enjoyable to taste
 These items ere they go to waste,
 But how annoying when one finds
 That other mice with pagan minds
 Come into church my food to share
 Who have no proper business there.
 Two field mice who have no desire
 To be baptized, invade the choir.
 A large and most unfriendly rat
 Comes in to see what we are at.
 He says he thinks there is no God
 And yet he comes ... it's rather odd.
 This year he stole a sheaf of wheat
 (It screened our special preacher's seat),
 And prosperous mice from fields away
 Come in to hear our organ play,
 And under cover of its notes
 Ate through the altar's sheaf of oats.
 A Low Church mouse, who thinks that I
 Am too papistical, and High,
 Yet somehow doesn't think it wrong
 To munch through Harvest Evensong,
 While I, who starve the whole year through,
 Must share my food with rodents who
 Except at this time of the year
 Not once inside the church appear.
 Within the human world I know
 Such goings-on could not be so,
 For human beings only do
 What their religion tells them to.
 They read the Bible every day
 And always, night and morning, pray,
 And just like me, the good church mouse,
 Worship each week in God's own house,
 But all the same it's strange to me
 How very full the church can be
 With people I don't see at all
 Except at Harvest Festival.",,"""Diary of a Church Mouse"" by John Betjeman is a humorous poem from the perspective of a church mouse who spends his days alone in a forgotten church, nibbling on old service books and living off scraps. He looks forward to Autumn's Harvest Festival when he can feast on ears of corn and other treats around the font. However, he is often disturbed by other mice, including two field mice who have no desire to be baptized, and a large rat who questions the existence of God. Despite the church being full of people during Harvest Festival, the mouse notes that he rarely sees them except at that time of year.","The poem is written from the perspective of a mouse who lives in a church. The mouse spends its days scavenging for food among the dusty, forgotten corners of the church, surviving on scraps and crumbs. The mouse is particularly fond of the Harvest Festival, when it can feast on ears of corn and other treats. However, the mouse is annoyed by the presence of other mice and rodents who invade the church during this time, stealing food and causing trouble. The poem also touches on the contrast between the mouse's simple, instinctual worship and the more complex, organized worship of humans, who attend church regularly and follow a set of rules. The poem is a humorous and lighthearted commentary on the human experience of faith and community.","The poem is narrated by a church mouse who lives in the church and survives on scraps and crumbs.

"I Saw From the Beach' by Thomas Moore addresses life's passions and compares them, through a metaphor, to the changing tides. The poet begins by describing a boat on the water. It moves with the tide, beautifully and powerfully at first (in the morning). Then, when the speaker comes back later, the water is gone and the boat is still there. The soul, as symbolized through the boat, remains, but the passion, symbolized through the water, is gone. This is an unstoppable change but one that the speaker wishes the reverse anyway. He pleads to feel something of the passion of youth/morning again.","Generate a short summary of I Saw From the Beach by Thomas Moore by Thomas Moore: I saw from the beach, when the morning was shining,

 And such is the fate of our life's early promise,
 So passing the spring-tide of joy we have known;
 Each wave that we danced on at morning ebbs from us,
 And leaves us, at eve, on the bleak shore alone.

 When passion first waked a new life through his frame,
 And his soul, like the wood that grows precious in burning,
 Gave out all its sweets to love's exquisite flame.",,"""I Saw From the Beach"" by Thomas Moore is a poetic reflection on the transience of life and the passage of time. The poem describes the sight of a bark (a small boat) moving gracefully on the water during the morning, but when the sun sets and the day ends, the boat remains while the water has receded, leaving the bark stranded on the beach. This image serves as a metaphor for the fleeting nature of life's joys and experiences, as each moment, like a wave, passes and leaves us alone on the shore. The poem also expresses a longing for the return of the moments when passion and love were new and vibrant in our lives.","The poem ""I Saw from the Beach"" by Thomas Moore reflects on the fleeting nature of life's promise and joy. The speaker describes seeing a ship sailing majestically on the water at dawn, but by evening, the ship remains while the water has disappeared.

The poem longs for the return of the passion and intensity of youth, when life was full of promise and love was all-consuming.","The poem ""I Saw From the Beach"" by Thomas Moore is a metaphorical reflection on the transient nature of life's joys and promises.

"At the Parrot House, Taronga Park' by Vivian Smith depicts birds and their interactions. The speaker begins the text by trying to convey how beautiful the birds in the parrot house are. It's hard for him to find the right images to describe their colors and what they make him think of. There is an interesting transition in the middle of the poem when the speaker moves from admiring the parrots to using personification to describe them. The poet uses human-specific interactions and emotions to describe the parrots in less than complimentary detail. The poem concludes with the poet noting that although the parrots looked beautiful, many negative things were going on.","Generate a short summary of At the Parrot House, Taronga Park by Vivian Smith by Vivian Smith: What images could yet suggest their range

 They chatter and they squawk and sometimes scream.

 the young galahs talking as they feed
 with feathers soft and pink as dawn on snow

 Their murmuring embraces every need
 from languid vanity to wildest greed.

 their heads together in a kind of love.

 Arise, o friend of the afflicted; arise and see the state of Punjab, Corpses strewn on fields, and the Chenaab flowing with much blood.
 Someone filled the five rivers with poison, And this same water now irrigates our soil.
 Where was lost the flute, where the songs of love sounded? And all Ranjha's brothers forgotten to play the flute.
 Blood has rained on the soil, graves are oozing with blood, The princesses of love cry their hearts out in the graveyards.

"In 'The Trashpickers, Madison Street,' Naomi Shihab Nye describes a scene from the early morning when trash pickers murmur while picking rags and sort the things that could be used further. At the beginning of the poem, readers can visualize the trash pickers carefully picking up all the trash one by one, checking inside each trashcan, and talking with each other while listing the things they find. It is astounding that some people see things thought of as “trash” in a completely different light by others who pick up that castaway stuff. Old nails, old paper, crooked skillets, and more like objects find new importance having been picked up. Trash offers glimpses into someone's existence and simultaneously speaks a lot about the old owner. It also hints at the condition of the new owner who picks it up. Reading the last stanza, one can understand that the poem is not simply about trash pickers picking up trash. It has deeper layers where the poet observes the things well-off people leave behind, the lasting effect it has upon people and the earth, and how the poor people who pick up those trash stuff weave dreams around those rejected items.","Generate a short summary of The Trashpickers, Madison Street by Naomi Shihab Nye by Naomi Shihab Nye: On the edge of dawn’s pale eye,

 What have we here?
 Their colorless overcoats drift and grow wings.
 

 They pull a creaking wagon, tinfoil wads, knotted string,
 to the cave where sacraments of usefulness are performed.
 Kneel to the triple weddings of an old nail.
 Rejoice in the rebirth of envelopes.
 The crooked skillet finds its first kingdom
 on a shelf where nothing is new.

 a swatch of velvet passed hand-to-hand.
 Their hearts are compasses fixed to the ground

 Fair Freedom rose New-England to adorn:
 The northern clime beneath her genial ray,
 Dartmouth, congratulates thy blissful sway:
 Elate with hope her race no longer mourns,
 Each soul expands, each grateful bosom burns,
 While in thine hand with pleasure we behold
 The silken reins, and Freedom's charms unfold.
 Long lost to realms beneath the northern skies
 

 She shines supreme, while hated faction dies:
 Soon as appear'd the Goddess long desir'd,
 Sick at the view, she languish'd and expir'd;
 Thus from the splendors of the morning light
 The owl in sadness seeks the caves of night.
 No more, America, in mournful strain
 Of wrongs, and grievance unredress'd complain,
 No longer shalt thou dread the iron chain,
 Which wanton Tyranny with lawless hand
 Had made, and with it meant t' enslave the land.
 

 Should you, my lord, while you peruse my song,
 Wonder from whence my love of Freedom sprung,
 Whence flow these wishes for the common good,
 By feeling hearts alone best understood,
 I, young in life, by seeming cruel fate
 Was snatch'd from Afric's fancy'd happy seat:
 What pangs excruciating must molest,
 What sorrows labour in my parent's breast?
 Steel'd was that soul and by no misery mov'd
 That from a father seiz'd his babe belov'd:
 Such, such my case. And can I then but pray
 Others may never feel tyrannic sway?
 

 For favours past, great Sir, our thanks are due,
 And thee we ask thy favours to renew,
 Since in thy pow'r, as in thy will before,
 To sooth the griefs, which thou did'st once deplore.
 May heav'nly grace the sacred sanction give
 To all thy works, and thou for ever live
 Not only on the wings of fleeting Fame,
 Though praise immortal crowns the patriot's name,
 But to conduct to heav'ns refulgent fane,
 May fiery coursers sweep th' ethereal plain,
 And bear thee upwards to that blest abode,
 Where, like the prophet, thou shalt find thy God.",,"""To the Right Honorable William, Earl of Dartmouth"" is a poem by Phillis Wheatley, a freed slave and the first published African American poet.

"In his poem 'of Modern Poetry,' Stevens shares his rules or theories on how “modern poetry” should be. According to him, it must be something new, something set upon real places, people, and events. It should not have inhibitions to address unpleasant subjects. Further, he wants Modern poetry to focus on the acts of the mind itself and expects it to help people find satisfaction in their lives itself. It further describes the new demands made on poetry by the complicated and skeptical age. The poet concludes by stating the possible subjects for poetry.","Generate a short summary of Of Modern Poetry by Wallace Stevens by Wallace Stevens: The poem of the mind in the act of finding What will suffice.

"The Vanity Of Wealth' by Samuel Johnson is a simple, yet impactful, poem that addresses what is important and unimportant in one's life. The poem is addressed to a specific listener who the speaker is trying to get through to in regards to what they value. Up until this point, money has been the controlling factor in their life and the speaker wants to change that.

 Which not all India's treasure buys!

 Let noble views engage thy mind.

 Or learn the Muses' moral lay;
 In social hours indulge thy soul,
 Where mirth and temperance mix the bowl;
 To virtuous love resign thy breast,
 And be, by blessing beauty, - bless'd.

 Ere youth and all its joys are fled;
 Come taste with me the balm of life,
 Secure from pomp, and wealth, and strife.

"Inspection' takes place during a military parade. A private is singled out by Wilfred Owen, and a Sergeant, for having blood on his suit, although later he admits to Owen that the blood was his own. The poem begins directly with the conversation between a soldier and Owen's speaker. It seems he is the instructor of the parade. He is angry with a spot of blood on the soldier's uniform. Suddenly, the sergeant comes into the conversation and rebukes him for the misbehavior. The offender is confined in a camp as punishment. In the following stanzas, the poet features what the sergeant tells the speaker. He clarifies that blood is “dirt” to them. It hinders them from doing the main task they are entitled to do, which is spilling more blood. To do this task, they must be tidy enough, not bearing the stains of their past activities. Owen, pointing out that it is no excuse, is told by the soldier that the world itself doesn't like them being so alive, and that true justice will occur when they are all dead.","Generate a short summary of Inspection by Wilfred Owen by Wilfred Owen: ""You!

 An envy of that one consummate part
 Swept me, who mock. Whether I laugh or weep,
 Some inner silences are at my heart.
 Cold shame is mine for all the masks I wear,
 Belying that in me which shines and sings

"‘Dreams’ is a poem regarding how regretful memories of the past have a tendency to haunt us. Over a course of fourteen lines, Helen Hunt Jackson covers the negative effects that dreams have on our lives. She specifically targets how dreams often revive the sorrowful memories of our past and in a way, make us relive the event that we were trying desperately to forget. A driving point in her poem is that we will carry sadness with us until we die. The poem ‘Dreams’ is rich with imagery, and imagery is the strongest device Jackson uses to highlight the main point of her poem. Despite the fact that the poem is entitled Dreams, it does not focus on the general essence of dreams. Jackson explicitly only targets the negative effects that dreams often have when we are compelled to remember our past through them.
 

 Dreams are generally seen as positive, motivating tools that most people look forward to. Dreams are a synonym for goals and aspirations. However, in her poem, Jackson describes dreams as experiences that highlight depression and gloom. The title Dreams can be perceived as an oxymoron, because Jackson means for it to contradict itself. The entire poem can be seen as satirical in nature, because the content contrasts strongly with the selected title, almost in a mocking tone.","Generate a short summary of Dreams by Helen Hunt Jackson by Helen Hunt Jackson: I dreamed that I ws dead and crossed the heavens,--
 Heavens after heavens with burning feet and swift,--
 And cried: ""O God, where art Thou?"" I left one
 On earth, whose burden I would pray Thee lift.""
 

 I was so dead I wondered at no thing,--
 Not even that the angels slowly turned
 Their faces, speechless, as I hurried by
 (Beneath my feet the golden pavements burned);
 

 Nor, at the first, that I could not find God,
 Because the heavens stretched endlessly like space.
 At last a terror siezed my very soul;
 I seemed alone in all the crowded place.
 

 Then, sudden, one compassionate cried out,
 Though like the rest his face from me he turned,
 As I were one no angel might regard
 (Beneath my feet the golden pavements burned):
 

 ""No moew in heaven than earth will he find God
 Who does not know his loving mercy swift
 But waits the moment consummate and ripe,
 Each burden, from each human soul to lift.""
 

 Though I was dead, I died again for shame;
 Lonely, to flee from heaven again I turned;
 The ranks of angels looked away from me
 (Beneath my feet the golden pavements burned)",,"In ""Dreams"" by Helen Hunt Jackson, the speaker describes her experience of dying and entering heaven. She is surprised by the burning pavements and the indifference of the angels, and cries out to God for comfort.

"Border Country' by Owen Sheers is a moving poem about childhood and how growing up can change one's perceptions about everything. The poem takes the reader back to Sheer's own youth and contrasts it with the experiences he has now, as a grown man, as he explores an old car quarry. There, he used to play with his friends and explore their limited freedom. The poem also alludes to the loss of a friend's father, deep emotional trauma, and what it means to grow up and leave one's childhood behind.","Generate a short summary of Border Country by Owen Sheers by Owen Sheers: Nothing marks the car quarry now,
 just raised earth like the hummock of a grave,
 a headstone of trees, wind-written epitaphs
 running in their leaves.
 Filled in years ago,
 but still I can't help standing at its edge,
 where the ground once gave
 to an elephant's graveyard of cars,
 a motorway pile-up in the corner of the field.
 

 One of the places we came
 when we had tired of catching
 the commas and apostrophes
 of minnows and bullheads;
 or shooting at pumpkins in the field,
 shouldering the kick of your father's shotgun;
 or playing at war in the barn,
 dying again and again
 under its gap-toothed roof and broken beams.
 

 

 A place where we tested our voices,
 young as the buzzards above us
 striking their cries against a flint sky,
 smashed black holes in the windows,
 sat in the drivers' seats, going nowhere,
 operated on engines,
 dock-leaves and nettles running in their pistons
 or just walked among them,
 reading aloud from the names of the dead:
 

 Volvo, Ford, Vauxhall,
 Their primary colours rusting to red.
 Where we lost ourselves in the hours before dark,
 year on year, until that day
 when life put on the brakes
 and pitched you, without notice,
 through the windscreen of your youth.
 Your father found at dawn —
 a poppy sown in the unripe corn.
 

 I came back once, to find the cars smaller
 or the undergrowth grown,
 whichever, the whole diminished to steel and stone.
 Just cars in a quarry,
 their dashboards undone and the needles
 of the speedos settled at zero.
 As I climbed back out I disturbed a buzzard
 that flew from its branch like a rag
 shaken out in the wind,
 before spiralling upwards
 above the shuffling trees
 and on over the fields —
 the spittle sheep, the ink-dot cows,
 a tractor writing with its wheels,
 and on over the lanes, where a boy
 meandered between the hedges,
 trailing a stick, kicking a stone,
 trying once more to find his way home.",,"""Border Country"" by Owen Sheers is a poetic reflection on childhood memories and the passage of time.

"And Death Shall Have No Dominion' is a magical look at the ways in which death controls mankind and the fact at even though it is powerful, it cannot control everything.

"Requiem for the Croppies' by Seamus Heaney describes the tragedy of the Irish Rebellion of 1798 from the perspective of a soldier. 'Requiem for the Croppies' begins with the speaker describing how he, and his companions have “greatcoats full of barley.” They are on the move, or as he says, “on the run”. There is no time for them to strike camp, and there are also no kitchens for them to cook in. The speaker implies that they are being attacked and are forced to flee in their own lands. He is hoping to draw the reader's attention to the aggressive nature of the British forces. These lines also suggest that the rebellion is not as organized as it could be.

 We'd cut through reins and rider with the pike
 And stampede cattle into infantry,
 Then retreat through hedges where cavalry must be thrown.

 Life is real! Life is earnest!
 And the grave is not its goal;
 Dust thou art, to dust returnest,

 Is our destined end or way;

 And our hearts, though stout and brave,
 Still, like muffled drums, are beating
 Funeral marches to the grave.

 Be a hero in the strife!
 Trust no Future, howe’er pleasant!
 Let the dead Past bury its dead!
 Act,— act in the living Present!
 Heart within, and God o’erhead!

 We can make our lives sublime,
 And, departing, leave behind us

 Sailing o’er life’s solemn main,

"Plenty' by Isobel Dixon describes the relationships a speaker had while she was a child and how she interprets them now that she is an adult. The poem begins with the speaker informing the reader that she had four siblings and they all tormented their mother. The family lived in poverty, without enough water to run a full bath. Although the speaker was always present in the house, she didn't realize that it was due to money concerns that her mother was never truly happy. The speaker states that all the children thought their mother was mean. Now that she is older, the speaker is able to look back on her life and know why her mother acted the way she did. She misses the interactions with all of her family members and still carries a bit of guilt for what she has now, compared to then, when taking a full bubble bath.","Generate a short summary of Plenty by Isobel Dixon by Isobel Dixon: When I was young and there were five of us,

 Such plenty was too dear in our expanse of drought
 where dams leaked dry and windmills stalled.
 Like Mommy’s smile. Her lips stretched back
 and anchored down, in anger at some fault –
 of mine, I thought – not knowing then
 it was a clasp to keep us all from chaos.
 She saw it always, snapping locks and straps,
 the spilling: sums and worries, shopping lists
 for aspirin, porridge, petrol, bread.
 Even the toilet paper counted,
 and each month was weeks too long.
 Her mouth a lid clamped hard on this.
 We thought her mean. Skipped chores,
 swiped biscuits – best of all
 when she was out of earshot
 stole another precious inch
 up to our chests, such lovely sin,
 lolling luxuriant in secret warmth
 disgorged from fat brass taps,
 our old compliant co-conspirators.

 The shower’s a hot cascade

"In ‘Questions About Angels,’ Collins whimsically interrogates conventional religious thinking by examining the common phrase: How many angels can dance on the head of a pin? He follows it up with a series of amusing and imaginative questions about angels, emphasizing the importance of having an individual relationship with religion. Collins’ concluding image of an angel dancing in the club suggests that heaven is found not in medieval thought experiments but in the beauty of ordinary life. Instead, he starts proposing more imaginative, even silly, questions about angels. These range from how they change color to what happens when they fall through clouds. He pushes back against the controlling nature of Christian tradition by imagining a single angel dancing in a jazz club, grounding his belief in the present moment.","Generate a short summary of Questions About Angels by Billy Collins by Billy Collins: Of all the questions you might want to ask
 about angels, the only one you ever hear
 is how many can dance on the head of a pin.
 

 No curiosity about how they pass the eternal time
 besides circling the Throne chanting in Latin
 or delivering a crust of bread to a hermit on earth
 or guiding a boy and girl across a rickety wooden bridge.
 

 Do they fly through God's body and come out singing?
 Do they swing like children from the hinges
 of the spirit world saying their names backwards and forwards?
 Do they sit alone in little gardens changing colors?
 

 What about their sleeping habits, the fabric of their robes,
 their diet of unfiltered divine light?
 What goes on inside their luminous heads? Is there a wall
 these tall presences can look over and see hell?
 

 If an angel fell off a cloud, would he leave a hole
 in a river and would the hole float along endlessly
 filled with the silent letters of every angelic word?
 

 If an angel delivered the mail, would he arrive
 in a blinding rush of wings or would he just assume
 the appearance of the regular mailman and
 whistle up the driveway reading the postcards?
 

 No, the medieval theologians control the court.
 The only question you ever hear is about
 the little dance floor on the head of a pin
 where halos are meant to converge and drift invisibly.
 

 It is designed to make us think in millions,
 billions, to make us run out of numbers and collapse
 into infinity, but perhaps the answer is simply one:
 one female angel dancing alone in her stocking feet,
 a small jazz combo working in the background.
 

 She sways like a branch in the wind, her beautiful
 eyes closed, and the tall thin bassist leans over
 to glance at his watch because she has been dancing
 forever, and now it is very late, even for musicians.",,"""Questions About Angels"" by Billy Collins is a poetic exploration of the human curiosity about angels and the seemingly mundane question that has consumed theologians for centuries: how many angels can dance on the head of a pin. The poem ponders various intriguing questions about angels, such as their sleeping habits, diet, and appearance, but the medieval theologians' fixation on the pin question overshadows all other inquiries. The poem concludes with an imaginative scene of a solitary female angel dancing to a small jazz combo, inviting us to ponder the infinite possibilities beyond the confines of the question about the pin.","In ""Questions About Angels"" by Billy Collins, the speaker pokes fun at the traditional notion of angels by asking a series of unconventional questions about their lives and habits. The poem explores the idea that we often focus on trivial or abstract questions about angels, such as how many can dance on the head of a pin, rather than more meaningful or practical ones. The speaker imagines angels engaging in everyday activities, like delivering mail or sitting in gardens, and wonders about their personal habits, like their sleeping and eating habits. The poem ultimately suggests that the answer to these questions may be simple and unexpected, such as a single female angel dancing alone to a jazz combo. The poem is a humorous and imaginative exploration of the human fascination with angels and the divine.","The poem explores the many unanswered questions we have about angels, beyond the common question of how many can dance on the head of a pin. The speaker wonders about the daily lives and activities of angels - how they spend their eternal time, what they eat, how they sleep, and whether they can see into hell. The poem suggests that while theologians have focused on the esoteric question of the dancing angels, there are many other intriguing mysteries about the nature and existence of angels that remain unexplored. The poem culminates in an imagined scene of a single female angel dancing alone, lost in her own reverie, as a small jazz combo plays in the background, highlighting the poetic and imaginative possibilities beyond the narrow theological debates."
"Sweet Rose of Virtue' by William Dunbar describes the changed feelings of a speaker who no longer understands a woman he used to love. The poem begins with the speaker professing his love for the listener by listing off her attributes. He has, in the past, seen her as being virtuous, gentle, and sweet.

"Air Raid' by Chinua Achebe relates the events of the Nigerian Civil War from a civilian's point of view. 'Air Raid' has a rapid-fire opening. The poem immediately takes us to the war setting, where aircraft are literally reigning death on civilians. It doesn't mellow out in the second stanza.

"Pomegranate by D. H. Lawrence begins by directly questioning the reader's authority on right and 'wrong'.

How he decides to live his life is up to him, 'I am not wrong'. Lawrence takes us on a journey around three cities, 'Syracuse', 'Venice', and 'Tuscany' in order to compare the differing Pomegranates that he finds in each of the locations. This symbol of the pomegranate can be understood as a metaphor for love, Lawrence connecting the red heart and the deep red color of the pomegranate.

 And crowns, kingly, generous, tilting crowns
 Over the left eyebrow.
